# format-shipped.sh — GH #531. Dogfood Prettier on the SHIPPED surface: the files install.sh copies
# (verbatim or renamed) into consumer projects. Keeping these prettier-clean is what makes a fresh
# consumer's `prettier --check .` (part of `npm run validate`) green out-of-box — the framework was
# never running its own authored skill docs / configs / rule sources through Prettier.
#
# SCOPE: the shipped artifacts ONLY — NOT the framework's own README/CLAUDE/.claude/rules/
# docs/meta-factory (out of the consumer surface and authority-owned; reformatting them would be a
# huge unrelated diff). GENERATED install artifacts (rendered RULES.md, .claude/settings.json, the
# eslint-rules-local/index.ts barrel) are excluded — they have no stable authored source and ship
# under .prettierignore; see packages/core/templates/shared/.prettierignore. Framework-internal
# *.test.ts under shipped dirs do not ship and are excluded.
#
# Implementation: enumerate the ACTUAL tracked files under the shipped paths (git ls-files), filter
# to Prettier-handled extensions, then run prettier on that explicit list — this avoids the
# "No files matching the pattern" error that per-extension globs hit when a dir has none of an ext.
#
# Usage: format-shipped.sh --check   (default; CI gate — fails if any shipped source is unformatted)
#        format-shipped.sh --write   (fix in place)

# Shipped paths (dirs + the exact pre-push closure — NOT the whole hooks/ dir, which is mostly
# framework-internal tests + the dynamically-imported guard-liveness.ts that does not ship).
