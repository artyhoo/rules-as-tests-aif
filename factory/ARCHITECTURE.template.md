# Architecture — server-side TypeScript

> Layer rules and dependency direction. Enforced by `dependency-cruiser`.
> For React/Next.js projects, see `ARCHITECTURE.react-next.md` instead.
>
> **Note on the `.template` suffix:** despite the filename, this file contains
> no `<PLACEHOLDER>` markers — it's a complete, ready-to-use architecture for
> the canonical hexagonal/clean server-side TS layout. The `.template` suffix
> means "drop into `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` and override only what your
> project needs". If your layout matches as-is, just rename to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Dependency rules (enforced by dependency-cruiser)

- `domain/` → nothing project-internal (only stdlib + Zod)
- `application/` → `domain/` only (talks to infra via `application/ports/`)
- `infrastructure/` → `application/ports/` + `domain/`
- `web/` → `application/` + `web/contracts/`
- No cycles between modules
- No cross-feature imports — features go through their `index.ts` only
- No imports from devDependencies in production code

## Test structure

Tests live next to source files (no `__tests__/` folder). Suffix indicates kind:

| Kind | Suffix | Example | Run by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `.unit.ts` | `src/domain/order.unit.ts` | `vitest run` |
| Integration | `.integration.ts` | `src/infrastructure/order-repo.integration.ts` | `vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts` |
| Audit (rule check) | `.audit.ts` | `tests/audit/agents-md.audit.ts` | `vitest run` |

Files without these suffixes are not considered tests — meta-tests will flag any that look like tests but aren't named correctly.

## Forbidden patterns

- `enum` declarations — use `as const` objects or `z.enum`.
- `Date.now()`, `new Date()` in `src/` (except `infrastructure/clock/`) — inject Clock.
- `Math.random()` in `src/` (except `infrastructure/random/`) — inject Random.
- Direct `fs`, `http`, `https` imports in `domain/` or `application/`.
- Mutable global state (`let` at module top level outside `config/`).
- Default exports (only named).
- Field injection / service locators.

## Observability requirements

- Every public `application/` command/query opens an OTel span via `tracer.startActiveSpan(...)`.
- Span attributes include: `user.id`, `request.id`, active feature flags, business outcome.
- All errors logged with structured context (never bare error strings).
- Errors set span status with structured `cause`.

## Rules of communication between modules

- Application calls infrastructure **through ports** (interfaces in `application/ports/`).
- Infrastructure implements ports — no direct imports of infra from application.
- Cross-feature communication happens through public `index.ts` (Feature-Sliced Design).
- Domain events emitted by domain layer, consumed by application; infrastructure can publish to external queues.

## Where rules are enforced

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| No cycles | dependency-cruiser |
| Layer direction | dependency-cruiser |
| No `as any` | ESLint `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` + `audit-ai-docs.sh` probe `R1` |
| No `Date.now()` outside infra | ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` + `audit-ai-docs.sh` probe `R7` |
| No forbidden imports | ESLint `no-restricted-imports` + `audit-ai-docs.sh` probe `R9` |
| OTel span on application functions | `audit-ai-docs.sh` probe `R8` |
| Tests for new public exports | `audit-ai-docs.sh` probe `R4` |

See `.ai-factory/RULES.md` for full list R1–R11 and `references/checks-map.md` for the full enforcement layer map.
