# PostToolUse gate — M6 edit-time channel for `#worker-dispatch-via-subagent`.
# On Edit|Write|MultiEdit of a `.claude/orchestrator-prompts/<umbrella>/kickoff.md`,
# delegates to the SINGLE shared matcher (29-worker-dispatch-channel.bin.ts → .ts)
# and exit 1 on a hit. Both this hook and principle 29's CI test call that one
# matcher — never two divergent copies (anti-pattern `#two-prompts-drift`).
#
# @dual-pair: channel-discipline-worker-dispatch
# @cc-only-rationale: edit-time PostToolUse enforcement is the earliest reachable
#   channel for the kickoff author; it fires only for the session editing the file
#   in Claude Code. The harness-agnostic backstop is the paired CI principle test
#   (packages/core/principles/29-worker-dispatch-channel.test.ts), which catches any
#   kickoff authored outside CC or pasted in pre-wired — together they cover both
#   the earliest-channel and the portability goals (spec §3, dual-implementation §6).
# spec: docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-06-27-meta-orch-channel-discipline-mechanism.md
#
# MAINTAINER WIRING (agent-uncommittable — add to ~/.claude/settings.json by hand):
#   Append this object to .hooks.PostToolUse (alongside the existing Edit|Write|MultiEdit
#   entries, e.g. check-kickoff-traps.sh / check-doc-authority.sh):
#     {
#       "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
#       "hooks": [
#         { "type": "command",
#           "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/check-worker-dispatch-channel.sh" }
#       ]
#     }
#   Until wired, the CI principle test is the active backstop (no enforcement gap —
#   it gates every PR; the hook only moves the gate earlier, to edit-time).
#
# Graceful no-op (exit 0) without jq/tsx, off-path, or when the bin shim is absent —
# repo PostToolUse-gate convention (cf. check-doc-authority.sh).
