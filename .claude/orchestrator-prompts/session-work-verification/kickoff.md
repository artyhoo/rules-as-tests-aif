# session-work-verification — cold re-verify the 2026-06-17 bug-fix + kickoff session

- **Type:** verification / cold audit (read-only + tests; no new feature). Run via `/pipeline`.
- **Opened:** 2026-06-17.
- **Base:** staging.
- **Why this exists:** the 2026-06-17 session fixed 3 bugs and authored 2 feature kickoffs and self-verified them, but the maintainer wants an **independent** re-verification in a fresh session before trusting the work — "главное это проверить то что здесь сделали". CI green on the PRs is NOT sufficient proof (see T-Verify-A below).

## What was done this session (the subject under verification)

**PR #598** (squash `4f8ed0f` on staging) — 3 bounded fixes, issues #548/#549/#568 closed:
1. **#549** `templates/ts-server/stryker.config.json` — added `"plugins": ["@stryker-mutator/vitest-runner","@stryker-mutator/typescript-checker"]` so Stryker loads checkers on pnpm (was rc=1, zero mutants).
2. **#548** `packages/core/hooks/deps-hash-check.sh` (+ the byte-identical `.claude/hooks/` dogfood copy) — keep the per-prompt nudge but emit "tool decisions not yet baselined" for the `<pending>` placeholder instead of the false "deps changed". `+` new test in `deps-hash-check.test.ts`; the stale-hash fixture was corrected.
3. **#568** `packages/core/hooks/{pre-push.ts,pre-push.fallback.sh,utils/git.ts}` — new `resolveDefaultBase()` (origin/HEAD → origin/staging|main|master) replacing hardcoded origin/staging, in BOTH dual-pair channels. `+` 5 unit tests in `utils/git.test.ts`, updated `tests/hooks/prepush-upstream-ref.test.sh` (case 8 + new case 9) and `tests/hooks/prepush-fallback-base-ref.test.sh` (FB4 + new FB5).

**PR #599** (on staging) — 2 feature kickoffs authored: `consumer-upgrade-path/kickoff.md` (#551) + `aif-init-passport-gen/kickoff.md` (#547 Point 1).

## What to verify (acceptance — each needs file:line or command output, no prose-only)

1. **#549 correctness:** confirm `plugins` present + valid JSON; confirm the issue's diagnosis (pnpm auto-discovery) is what `plugins` fixes. INCONCLUSIVE-needs-consumer is an acceptable verdict for the full mutation run (no consumer here) — say so explicitly, do not fake it.
2. **#548 correctness + no regression:** run `vitest run packages/core/hooks/deps-hash-check.test.ts` → all green; confirm byte-identity of the two `.sh` copies; confirm the real-mismatch path still says "deps changed" and ONLY the unbaselined path changed.
3. **#568 correctness + no regression:** run `vitest run packages/core/hooks/utils/git.test.ts` AND both bash tests (`tests/hooks/prepush-upstream-ref.test.sh`, `tests/hooks/prepush-fallback-base-ref.test.sh`) → all green. Confirm `resolveDefaultBase` exists in BOTH channels (TS + bash) and the fix is not cosmetic-on-one-side.
4. **CI gate intact:** `npm --prefix packages/core run test:principles` → 206+ green.
5. **#599 kickoffs sound:** confirm both feature kickoffs pass principle 12, carry the §3 obligations, and their links resolve.
6. **No drive-by damage:** `git diff origin/staging~2..origin/staging --stat` — confirm the session touched only its declared files.

## Out of scope

- Fixing the ~15 failing `packages/core/hooks/` tests — that is the SEPARATE `hook-test-suite-rot` kickoff. Here, only confirm they are PRE-EXISTING (present before this session's commits) and unrelated to the 3 fixes — do not fix them.
- Executing the #551/#547 features (separate aif dispatch).

## §6 AI-traps (ai-laziness-traps §3 obligations)

See [.claude/rules/ai-laziness-traps.md §2](../../../.claude/rules/ai-laziness-traps.md). Active traps: **T3, T7, T14, T15, T19**.

- **T3** — every verdict needs command output or file:line, never "looks fine".
- **T7** — actually run the adversarial re-check; a clean pass with low coverage is "insufficient to conclude", not "verified" (T14).
- **T14** — distinguish "fix verified green" from "fix unverifiable here (needs consumer)".
- **T19** — this IS the own-cold-QA step; do it as a hostile reviewer, not a rubber stamp.
- **T-Verify-A** (domain-specific) — the verifier is tempted to treat "PR #598 CI was green" as proof the 3 fixes are correct. But CI runs only `vitest principles/` + a few bash steps — it does NOT run the `packages/core/hooks/` vitest suite where #548/#568's own tests live. So "CI green" proves form, not these fixes' behaviour. Counter: re-run the named hook tests yourself; cite their output.

## Dispatch note

Per [kickoff-staging-placement.md](../../../.claude/rules/kickoff-staging-placement.md): on `staging` before `/pipeline session-work-verification`.
