# ai-doc — AI-doc authoring standard (thin wrapper)

## Overview
Composes existing skills; does NOT reinvent. For the authoring mechanics invoke
`superpowers:writing-skills` (TDD-for-docs + bundled Anthropic best-practices + progressive
disclosure). This wrapper adds only the residue upstream lacks → see
[anthropic-and-aif-residue.md](anthropic-and-aif-residue.md) (loaded on demand).

## The standard (judgment calls; mechanics are upstream)
- **Channel by `rule-enforcement-channel-selection.md` §1–§4**: detectability → gate vs injection; relevance → narrowest reliable trigger. Reserve always-on for the 3–4 invariants.
- **Rule = test = code at the earliest channel** (zero standing context); prose lives on-demand/path-scoped. Both hold at once (spec §Reconciliation).
- **AI-agnostic**: portable `<!-- globs: -->` marker + AIF template-vars; degrade without the harness.
- **Doc-authority header** per `doc-authority-hierarchy.md` §3 on any canonical doc.

## Without this skill
An agent authoring a new rule or skill defaults to front-loading all prose as always-on context — the path of least resistance. It picks «put it in CLAUDE.md» or adds a standalone always-on rule file, bloating the baseline without checking whether a script gate or path-scoped injection would serve the rule better. It does not consult `rule-enforcement-channel-selection.md`, does not verify channel activation with a live probe, and does not add a doc-authority header. The rule may be mechanically enforceable but ends up as prose-only, silently bypassed.

## With this skill
The agent follows the channel-selection two-axis decision procedure first: detectability → gate vs injection; relevance → narrowest reliable trigger. If a script gate catches the bypass, the prose is kept on-demand or path-scoped (not always-on). If the rule is pure behavioural discipline needing to shape reasoning in the moment, the agent routes it to a compressed digest + path/event-scoped injection rather than a standalone always-on wall. Every verdict cites a probe command or a 6-item negative-existence check — no prose-only findings. The delivered artefact carries a doc-authority header and a paired-negative block where required.
