# Red flags / Common mistakes (rationalization → STOP table)

> **Authoritative for:** the `/pipeline` red-flags catalogue — rationalizations that mean STOP and re-read the relevant section, plus the red-flag phrase list. Body of `../SKILL.md` points here.
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see [README.md#why-this-exists](../../../../README.md#why-this-exists). The sections each row points at — see `../SKILL.md`.

When operating under the `/pipeline` skill, the following rationalizations mean STOP and re-read the relevant section:

| Rationalization | Reality | Counter (section) |
|---|---|---|
| «Plan looked current last session, skip §1» | Plan-currency is per-invocation, not per-session — PRs merge between invocations | §1 (T4 anti-pattern) |
| «Launch-table can be from memory, kickoff hasn't changed» | Kickoff edits between invocations are invisible without re-read | §3 (T3 anti-pattern) |
| «Stage 1 was 'about to land' so dispatch Stage 2 now» | Stage gate is real `gh pr list --search "is:merged"` — never «about to» | §6 (Class C honesty) |
| «Both candidates feel similar — I'll pick A» | True ties go to maintainer as DECISION-NEEDED, not the meta-orchestrator | §2 step 4 + reviewer-discipline §2 |
| «Maintainer said 'выбирай сам' / "you decide" so DECISION-NEEDED is satisfied, I'll pick» | **NO** — «pick for me» / «оба норм» / "both fine" / «я устал» / "I'm busy" = *deferred* DECISION-NEEDED, not answered. Genuine answer is a content tiebreaker («pick X because Y about the umbrellas»). Re-surface with sharper framing or propose a coin-flip; do NOT silently pick. | §2 Step 4.1 ([anti-rationalization.md](anti-rationalization.md)) |
| «Phase -1 reviewer between stages is optional when stage was small» | Mandatory regardless of stage size (CI ≠ design review, T19) | §6 step 3 + §7 |
| «I'll quickly implement this trivial sub-wave inline» | Anti-scope: meta-orchestrator dispatches kickoffs; never implements | §8 anti-scope |
| «Modify `~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/` to align with this skill» | That file is agent-uncommittable; wrap, never fork or edit | §8 anti-scope |
| «`!shell` injection failed — proceed anyway with assumed values» | F6: emit DIAGNOSTIC and halt; do NOT assume gate is clear | §11 F6 |
| «Reviewer returned REVISE 3× — try once more» | F5: after 3 REVISE cycles, escalate to maintainer | §11 F5 |
| «`see ai-laziness-traps.md` is enough in the meta-kickoff §5» | Blanket reference is itself T7 — explicit T-enumeration mandatory | §4 step 3 + §5 + ai-laziness-traps.md §3 |

**Red flag phrases — STOP and re-verify:**

- «I'll fix the plan-sequencing entry after» → fix BEFORE dispatch; §1 stale plan blocks §2
- «one reviewer's enough» → meta-orchestrator's Phase -1 is mandatory between every stage
- «merged means runtime-verified» → stage-gate verifies merge, not runtime behaviour; verify-trace dispatch is separate
- «hypothetical Stage 3» → if Stage 3 isn't in the kickoff, do NOT invent it; surface to maintainer
