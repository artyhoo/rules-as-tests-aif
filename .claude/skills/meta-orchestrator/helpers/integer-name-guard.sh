# integer-name-guard.sh — V1 pre-invocation guard for SKILL.md §0.
# Asserts no umbrella directory under .claude/orchestrator-prompts/ is named as a
# bare integer (^[0-9]+$). An integer-named umbrella makes `/meta-orchestrator 1`
# ambiguous between named-umbrella dispatch and V4 top-N routing (§0 arg-routing).
#
# > Class: B — companion paired-negative test at
# >          packages/core/skills/integer-name-guard.test.ts.
# > Authoritative for: the §0 integer-name pre-invocation guard mechanism only.
# > NOT authoritative for: §0 arg-routing semantics (single-SSOT in SKILL.md §0).
#
# WHY A HELPER (not inline): the former inline form at SKILL.md §0 was a compound
# `ls … && { echo …; exit 2; }`. CC splits compounds by operator and vets each
# subcommand independently (permissions.md "Compound commands"); `exit` is NOT a
# CC read-only built-in and is not covered by this skill's allowed-tools, so the
# block forced the auto-mode safety classifier on every invocation. When the
# classifier was unavailable the whole /meta-orchestrator expansion died on its
# first block (§0). Routing through the allowlisted
# `Bash(bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/helpers/*.sh *)` entry removes that dependency.
#
# Usage: integer-name-guard.sh [orch-prompts-dir]
#   arg1 — dir to scan (default: .claude/orchestrator-prompts relative to cwd).
#          Passed explicitly by the §0 caller so the invocation carries a trailing
#          arg and matches the `*.sh *` allowlist glob (no-arg would not match).
#   exit 0 → no integer-named umbrella (safe to proceed)
#   exit 2 → integer-named umbrella found (ERROR printed to stderr; halt)
#
# Seam:
#   MO_ORCH_PROMPTS_DIR — override scan dir for tests (lower precedence than arg1).
#
# @dual-pair: meta-orchestrator-integer-name-guard
# spec: SKILL.md §0 (caller) ↔ this file (guard logic).
# @cc-only-rationale: meta-orchestrator skill helper — runs in-session via !shell
#   injection at SKILL.md §0; no portable hook fires at the per-skill
#   pre-invocation moment. Pure-bash + grep, deterministic, no paid LLM
#   (no-paid-llm-in-ci.md §1 satisfied).
