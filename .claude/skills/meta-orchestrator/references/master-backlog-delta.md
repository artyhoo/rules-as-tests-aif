## §1 Delta injection (read side) — SKILL.md §2.5 Step 1 + Step 8

**Step 1** reads `untracked_seen[].id` via inline `jq` to surface the prior-sweep id set as context. **Step 8** invokes [`delta-diff.sh`](../helpers/delta-diff.sh) to compute the actual NEW-SINCE-LAST / RESOLVED-SINCE-LAST set diff between prior `untracked_seen` and the current L1+L2 candidate sweep — emitting one line per id-set difference into the §10 rendered dispatch report.

**Why two read-side touchpoints (not one):** Step 1's `jq -r '.untracked_seen[]?.id'` is a *context-priming* surface — it shows the AI what the last sweep saw, so judgment in Steps 2-7 (dup-detect / classify / assign / route / alias) is informed. Step 8 is a *deterministic diff*, run after the current candidate set is known. Collapsing them into one block would force the AI to do set-diff in judgment instead of via the helper — that is the §4 `#delta-as-source-of-truth` anti-pattern in disguise.

**`first_seen` semantics (binding for read-side):** `untracked_seen[].first_seen` records the **most recent sighting**, NOT the first-ever sighting (per SKILL.md §10 item 5b binding choice — overwrite-shape, not preserve-shape). Read-side code MUST NOT treat `first_seen` as a historical anchor; it is a per-invocation refresh stamp.

## §2 Delta-reconciliation rule — SKILL.md §2.5 Step 1 + Step 8

Compare prior `untracked_seen[].id` set (from Step 1) against the current L1+L2 mechanical sweep candidate set (output of §2 priority-score + L3 dup-detect). If divergence is detected — e.g. delta claims `<id>` was seen but the current `priority-score.sh` + `plan-currency-check.sh` output no longer surfaces it AND no merged PR closing it appears in `gh pr list --state merged` — emit:

> «DELTA STALE: `<id>` claimed seen at last sync `<ts>`, current sweep does not surface it AND no merge evidence. Re-deriving from mechanical state; delta treated as supplementary only.»

Delta is welcome supplementary input, **never load-bearing** — same model as cache reconciliation ([plan-cache.md §2](plan-cache.md)) and REPORT reconciliation (SKILL.md §1 Step 2 item 5; memory `feedback_no_human_verification_ai_self_verifies`). Mechanical state — `gh pr list`, `git log`, `ls`, the L1+L2 helpers — always wins.

**Divergence trigger condition (binding — NOT a copy of plan-cache.md §2):**

The reconciliation trigger here is **L1+L2-sweep divergence**, NOT git-HEAD-SHA divergence (which is plan-cache.md §2's trigger). The delta tracks *backlog-id state*, not *plan-file content state*; the reconciliation criterion is therefore:

- (a) `untracked_seen[].id` ∋ id, AND
- (b) current L1+L2 sweep does NOT surface id, AND
- (c) `gh pr list --state merged --search '<id-fragment>'` shows NO recent merge,

then divergence is **real** (item silently dropped from the backlog — investigate). Conversely, if (b) holds but (c) shows a merge, the divergence is **expected** (item closed since last sync) — emit `RESOLVED-SINCE-LAST: <id>` per Step 8 and proceed without alarm. Copying plan-cache.md §2's SHA-divergence check verbatim is the `T-Stage3-A` trap (see §4).

**T-mem-A counter** ([ai-laziness-traps.md §2](../../../rules/ai-laziness-traps.md), cache-as-source-of-truth drift): every «`<id>` is open» / «`<id>` is closed» claim derived from `untracked_seen` MUST be re-verified via the current L1+L2 sweep + `gh pr list` (which `plan-currency-check.sh` + `dup-detect.sh` already do — delta **precedes** but does **NOT replace** the mechanical probe). Reading the delta's id-set without re-running L1+L2 is the named anti-pattern (§4 `#delta-as-source-of-truth`). T-mem-A originally codified for plan-cache (plan-cache.md §2) extends to delta because the failure mode is identical (stage-0 cache trusted without re-verification); the counter rule is the same.

## §3 Delta-update step — SKILL.md §10 item 5b

At end of invocation, the two writes happen in this order (per SKILL.md §10 item 5b — already shipped Stage 2C):

1. **Body owns arrays** — the rendering AI inline-jq writes the `untracked_seen` + `closed_since_last` arrays from the current sweep (concrete `jq` template in SKILL.md §10 item 5b).
2. **Helper owns metadata** — `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/helpers/update-delta.sh "<umbrella-or-no-arg>" "<outcome-one-liner>"` refreshes `last_check_ts` + `last_check_git_head` only (idempotent; paired-negative test at [`packages/core/hooks/update-delta.test.ts`](../../../../packages/core/hooks/update-delta.test.ts)).

**Helper-scope contract** (mirrors [plan-cache.md §3](plan-cache.md) round-3 reduction of `update-cache.sh`): the writer (`update-delta.sh`) is deterministic on TWO metadata fields only; the two arrays are populated by direct inline `jq` in SKILL.md §10 item 5b BEFORE the writer runs. This split keeps the writer's idempotency contract tight (covered by `update-delta.test.ts`), while the richer content flows through standard inline writes (no underspecified `$3..$N` interface).

**Single SSOT:** both helpers live at `.claude/skills/meta-orchestrator/helpers/` only — no consumer mirror under `skills/meta-orchestrator/` per [install.sh:233-235](../../../../install.sh) authority. `delta-diff.sh` (read side) is genuinely new this stage; `update-delta.sh` (metadata writer) shipped Stage 2B and is UNCHANGED in this stage.

## §4 Anti-patterns

- **`#delta-as-source-of-truth`** — reading `untracked_seen[].id` and trusting its «`<id>` is open» / «`<id>` is closed» claims without re-running `dup-detect.sh` + `gh pr list`. Counter: §2 reconciliation rule + T-mem-A in [ai-laziness-traps.md §2](../../../rules/ai-laziness-traps.md). Mirrors plan-cache.md §4 `#cache-as-source-of-truth`.
- **`#delta-arrays-writer-creep`** — extending `update-delta.sh` to write the two arrays (`untracked_seen` / `closed_since_last`) in addition to metadata. The two arrays MUST be populated by direct inline `jq` in SKILL.md body, not by the helper. Counter: helper-scope contract above (§3). Mirrors plan-cache.md §4 `#cache-writer-feature-creep`. Falsifier: a future PR adds `--with-arrays` flag or third positional arg `$3` for the array data → that PR violates this anti-pattern.
- **`#delta-clobbers-mechanical-state`** — letting prior `untracked_seen` content (stale) override what the current L1+L2 sweep surfaces. Counter: §2 mechanical-wins rule + Step 8 emits `RESOLVED-SINCE-LAST: <id>` for ids that dropped between sweeps, never silently retains them in dispatch output. Mirrors plan-cache.md §4 `#cache-clobbers-hand-edits`.
- **`T-Stage3-A` — `#cache-delta-mirror-pattern-mismatch`** — copying plan-cache.md §2's git-HEAD-SHA-divergence reconciliation trigger verbatim into the delta rule, instead of writing the L1+L2-sweep-divergence trigger that delta actually requires. Cache problem class = plan-file-content drift (SHA-anchored); delta problem class = backlog-id-set drift (sweep-anchored). T16 (pattern-matching-on-name) variant: «plan-cache.md is the precedent → mirror its §2 trigger condition» is wrong on the trigger; only the *shape* (supplementary-not-load-bearing + reconciliation-emit-prose + T-mem-A counter) mirrors. The trigger condition itself is built fresh per §2 above. Falsifier: a future edit to §2 introduces `git rev-parse HEAD` comparison without an L1+L2 sweep check → that edit triggers this anti-pattern.
