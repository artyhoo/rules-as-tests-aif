# Phase research coverage — searching discipline

> **Class:** A — companion principle test shipped at [packages/core/principles/13-phase-research-coverage-s17.test.ts](../../packages/core/principles/13-phase-research-coverage-s17.test.ts) (#74, 2026-05-17); enforces §1.7 Forward+Backward self-review on research patches via the HISTORICAL_CUTOFF mechanism.
> **Authoritative for:** searching-layer discipline rule — §1 6-item coverage methodology checklist, §2 self-reflection prompts for retros, §3 research-patches/ accumulator format (mirrors AIF /aif-evolve), §4 named anti-patterns for fast pattern-match.
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see [../../README.md#why-this-exists](../../README.md#why-this-exists). Recording-layer discipline (Prior-art trailer + SSOT + principle 08) — see [CLAUDE.md `Build-vs-reuse invariant`](../../CLAUDE.md). Discipline-layer SSOT (re-evaluation triggers for this rule) — see [open-questions.md §13.16](../../docs/meta-factory/open-questions.md).

Phase 8.8 mechanism (SSOT + principle 08 + `Prior-art:` trailer + pre-push hook) formalises **recording**: every claim cites prior art, every capability commit carries provenance. Phase 8.8.1 adds the **searching** layer on top: a rule + patch loop that catches false-negative coverage gaps before they ship as load-bearing claims.

The rule is invoked at the surfaces declared in `paths:` above — entry research files, the SSOT, and the `research-patches/` accumulator. It is consumed by phase research sessions before closing any [EXECUTION-PLAN.md §5.5](../../docs/meta-factory/EXECUTION-PLAN.md) Step 1.5 lookup, and by retros writing the Self-reflection block.

> **Delivery channel — CC-native `paths:` only; no `<!-- globs: -->` sibling, by design (T-SEF-A).** This rule's path-scope is delivered solely via the `paths:` frontmatter above (CC-native, read-time, whole-rule). It deliberately carries **no** `<!-- globs: -->` marker for the edit-time [`inject-matching-rule.sh`](../hooks/inject-matching-rule.sh) channel, and adding one would be a regression, not a fix: that hook's glob subset is only `prefix/**` | `*.ext` | exact ([`inject-matching-rule.sh:19-20`](../hooks/inject-matching-rule.sh) + `glob_match` at `:44-51`), which **cannot** express the `docs/meta-factory/phase-*-research.md` / `phase-*-entry-research.md` mid-path-star scope of `paths:`. The only hook-expressible superset, `docs/meta-factory/**`, would over-fire on **every** meta-factory doc edit — strictly broader than the `paths:` set and a violation of the «keep the two glob sets identical» dual-pair invariant ([rule-enforcement-channel-selection.md §4](rule-enforcement-channel-selection.md)). Native-only is therefore the correct channel here, not a coverage gap (`#own-stack-blind-spot`-adjacent: the over-broad sibling would inject noise, not signal). **Re-evaluate** only if `inject-matching-rule.sh` gains a mid-path glob engine that can match `phase-*-research.md` without broadening — at which point a `<!-- globs: -->` sibling mirroring `paths:` exactly becomes addable.

## §1 Coverage methodology checklist (10 items)

Apply before closing any «N candidates checked → no production analog» claim. Failing any single item → the negative-existence verdict is **provisional**, not load-bearing.

1. **Own-stack sweep.** Enumerate the explicit dependencies, integrated tools, and hard-coded references the project already uses (`package.json`, `aif-comparison.md`, `.claude/`, `docs/meta-factory/architecture.md`). For each, ask: *does this dependency itself ship a surface in the capability area under research?* Treating an own-stack dependency as «only a dep, not a competitor» is the dominant blind-spot pattern. *(Distilled from [AIF + Oh-My patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-aif-omg-coverage-gap.md).)*
2. **Category sweep.** Beyond keyword neighbours of the capability label, enumerate the *categories* of tools that could host an analog: agent harnesses, AI orchestration platforms, IDE-integrated assistants, CLI authoring frameworks, codemod toolkits. **Format-category sub-case** — when the artifact under design is a SSOT / register / log / contract / template (a *format*, not a *capability*), enumerate format-precedent categories instead: decision records (ADR / MADR / Y-statements), CHANGELOG variants, CODEOWNERS-shape registers, fitness-function tables. Hit at least one candidate per category before closing. *(Distilled from [AIF + Oh-My patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-aif-omg-coverage-gap.md) and [Phase 8.8 SSOT-vs-ADR patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-phase-8.8-ssot-format-vs-adr.md).)*
3. **Semantic-distance check.** If all candidates share the same surface vocabulary (e.g. all are «ESLint plugins» or all are «.mdc rule files»), the search is too narrow. Probe the *function* (what does the capability *do*?), then re-search at one paradigm step removed (e.g. «rule synthesis» → «skill self-improvement», «patch distillation», «accumulated lessons learned»). *(Distilled from [AIF + Oh-My patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-aif-omg-coverage-gap.md).)*
4. **Adversarial check on negative-existence claims.** A claim of the form «no production tool implements X» is a strong assertion. Before accepting it, generate at least one *counter-prompt* that assumes the tool exists and tries to find it («if X existed, where would it live? what would its docs page look like?»). If the counter-prompt surfaces a candidate, mark the original lookup incomplete. *(Distilled from [AIF + Oh-My patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-aif-omg-coverage-gap.md).)*
5. **Prompt-list ≠ complete.** Hard Constraint #5 / #10 in the entry-research prompt typically lists ≥3 candidates per area. That is a **floor, not a ceiling.** Closing at the floor is permitted only if items 1-4 above also hold. If they don't, the lookup must continue past the listed minimum. *(Distilled from [AIF + Oh-My patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-aif-omg-coverage-gap.md).)*
6. **Trigger sweep at phase entry research.** Before closing Step 1.5, run `grep -nE "^### 13\." docs/meta-factory/open-questions.md` and inspect every non-cascade §13.x entry. For each: decompose the trigger condition into observable signals (consumer evidence / repo state / file-existence / config bumps); run a verification probe; classify FIRED / STILL ARMED / CASCADE-DEPENDENT. Surface FIRED entries as `research-patches/2026-MM-DD-trigger-fire-§<N>.md` patches; record STILL ARMED in retro Trigger-health table. The push-based sweep complements pull-based recording — armed-but-not-fired triggers can sit indefinitely without it. *(Distilled from [trigger sweep report](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-trigger-sweep-report.md); seeded as foundational case from §13.16 itself.)*
7. **Recommendation self-discipline check.** Apply before closing any recommendation that introduces or extends a rule, principle, pattern, or discipline. Failing either direction → recommendation is **provisional**, not load-bearing.
    - **Forward-check (recommendation complies with existing disciplines).** Does the proposed change comply with all currently-active layers — code-level (R1-R20 lint), principle-level (`packages/core/principles/*.test.ts`), commit-level (capability-commit gate + `Prior-art:` trailer per [CLAUDE.md `Build-vs-reuse invariant`](../../CLAUDE.md)), build-vs-reuse SSOT (load-bearing patterns registered in `prior-art-evaluations.md`), trigger sweep (§1.6 — every armed §13.x in `open-questions.md`), doc-authority (artefacts produced by the recommendation themselves carry compliant headers per [`doc-authority-hierarchy.md`](doc-authority-hierarchy.md))?
    - **Backward-check (new rule applied to all existing artefacts).** Complete sweep of artefacts under the new rule's scope — not the §1.5 floor of «3-5 examples» but the *complete* set. Exemption mechanism (glob or sentinel) explicit. Exemption itself has a meta-test (positive: exemption preserves intent; mutation: removing exemption breaks intent).
    - **Self-reflexive trigger.** §1.7 applies to itself — every new discipline-bearing artefact ships with a *self-review patch* under [research-patches/](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/) following the T7 template ([2026-05-09-self-review-audit.md](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-09-self-review-audit.md)) — walks the proposed rule through §1.1-§1.7 and through §2.1-§2.5, verifying it would have caught the very gap that motivated its creation.
   *(Distilled from [recommendation-skips-own-discipline patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-09-recommendation-skips-own-discipline.md) — 2026-05-09 incident: research session on L3 generated-docs discipline produced a recommendation that itself failed forward+backward checks across 6 distinct existing disciplines; gap surfaced only via reviewer pushback, not via existing §1.1-§1.6.)*

### §1.8 Hook surface smoke-test (introduced 2026-05-11, Wave 7 review M1)

For every commit touching `.claude/hooks/*.sh` or any pre-push hook section, run a smoke-test with a path that the hook is intended to skip:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"'"$(pwd)"'/package.json"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/<hook-name>.sh; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=0`, no stderr. If the hook produces `exit=1` or stderr on a path outside its intended scope, the hook is leaking beyond its filter — fail the review, file as M-grade finding. Discovered when [Wave 7 Round 1 audit](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-11-wave-7-round1-review.md) Domain 4 declared «hooks all correct» without running this probe, missing a CLI shim regression that surfaced FAIL noise on every Edit/Write of non-doc files (closed by M1 fix 2026-05-11).

### §1.9 SSOT citation existence-check (introduced 2026-05-11, Wave 7 review M2)

For every commit body containing a positive `Prior-art: prior-art-evaluations.md#N` trailer (NOT the `Prior-art: skipped — …` escape hatch), verify that entry #N exists in the SSOT at audit time:

```bash
grep -nE "^\| *${N} *\|" docs/meta-factory/prior-art-evaluations.md \
  || echo "ID #${N} missing from SSOT — capability cites non-existent entry"
```

Expected: matching row present. Verifying *trailer presence* is NOT the same as verifying the *SSOT entry exists*. [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) «add a new SSOT entry … in the same commit as the capability artifact» means the cited ID must be landed by-or-before the citing commit. Discovered when [Wave 7 Round 1 audit](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-11-wave-7-round1-review.md) Domain 8 reported «#17 ✓; #22 ✓» by trailer presence alone, missing two non-existent entries (closed by M2 fix 2026-05-11).

### §1.10 Type-system over prose for SDK-shaped claims (introduced 2026-05-16, three-channel verification finding)

For claims about SDK-shaped surfaces — hook payload fields, MCP tool contracts, settings.json schema, harness event interfaces, language-server APIs — when type-system evidence diverges from prose documentation, **type-system wins**. Types must compile against actual implementation; prose can be stale, imprecise, or omit fields the runtime nonetheless requires.

**How to apply:**

1. SDK-shaped claim? → check type-system evidence first (e.g., `agent-sdk/typescript.md` for Claude Code, `.d.ts` for npm packages).
2. Types + prose agree → AFFIRM, cite both.
3. Types + prose diverge → types win; mark prose as stale or imprecise, surface as research-patch candidate.
4. Only prose available (no SDK types for this surface) → continue dual-channel prose verification per §1.1-§1.9.

Discovered when three-channel verification of research-patch `2026-05-16-§17-think-time-gate.md` Stop-hook claims found Worker WebFetch + Reviewer WebFetch converged on the same prose misreading («Stop fires only at session end»). The third channel via `claude-code-guide` subagent with TypeScript SDK access resolved unambiguously — `StopHookInput` and `SessionEndHookInput` are distinct interfaces; `Stop` fires per assistant turn, `SessionEnd` fires once at session termination. Prose lifecycle table was contestable; type-system evidence was not.

Single-incident promotion (not the §1 closing «3-patch threshold») is acceptable here because the lesson is mechanically grounded — «types vs prose» is a structural distinction, not a heuristic. Future SDK-shaped patches will accumulate the evidence base. *(Distilled from [research-patches/2026-05-16-claude-code-guide-cross-verification.md §12.6](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-16-claude-code-guide-cross-verification.md) and [research-patches/2026-05-16-think-time-s17-gate-correction.md §4](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-16-think-time-s17-gate-correction.md).)*

### §1.11 Verify against source-of-truth before claim or ship-step (introduced 2026-05-22, DN-4 memory-codification)

Before asserting a state-claim or taking an irreversible ship-step, verify against the **authoritative source** (git / GitHub, decided-status docs) — never against session memory, a stale working tree, or a diff read in the wrong direction. Session memory drifts; parallel sessions mutate shared state; «local is live» is an assumption, not a fact. This is the operational generalisation of the §1.7 provisional-verdict principle (failing the forward/backward check → the recommendation is provisional) from *recommendations* to **any** claim or ship-step.

**How to apply:**

1. **State / closure claims** → trust git/GitHub, not session memory. Re-verify HEAD, branch, and own-commit reachability + `git status` before *each* ship-step (parallel sessions mutate state mid-cycle). Before any «Wave N not closed» / «X is done» negative-existence claim, run `gh pr list --search` + `ls` of the relevant dir. *(codifies memory `orchestrator_verify_state_before_claim`)*
2. **Decided-status before recommending** → grep memory + decision docs *before* recommending on scope/strategy; don't re-litigate settled calls. *(codifies `check_decided_status_before_recommending`)*
3. **In-flight work before building** → before opening a full PR on a tracked blocker/topic, run a **plain** `gh pr list --state open` scan (keyword `--search` is unreliable for very-recent PRs — read the list) for a parallel PR; on a dup, close the redundant branch and ship only the unique delta. *(codifies `check_inflight_prs_before_building`)*
4. **Diff direction before «local is live»** → on a behind-branch, prove newer-vs-stale *per file* via grep on distinctive content markers, NOT by reading `+`/`−` in a diff hunk; direction is per-file, not uniform. *(codifies `verify_diff_direction_before_live_claim`)*

The failure mode is the **verify-against-source-of-truth family**: 4+ incidents — 2026-05-16 stale HEAD on a long iterative cycle; 2026-05-21 re-litigated an already-decided call + edited a stale hook fork; 2026-05-21 PR #106 inverted-diff near-miss (caught by markdownlint luck); #80 duplicated parallel-merged #79. *(Distilled from memory entries codified per [memory-codification.md §3](memory-codification.md); DN-4 tracker rows #16/#17/#22/#28 in [memory-codification-gap-tracker.md](../../docs/meta-factory/memory-codification-gap-tracker.md).)*

### §1.12 Lead with a reasoned recommendation; act when the best path is clear (introduced 2026-05-22, DN-4 memory-codification)

The complement to §1.7 (back a verdict) and [reviewer-discipline.md §2](reviewer-discipline.md) (surface true strategy forks): when the next step — or the choice among options — has a clear best on the merits, **commit to it**; don't offload a decision you can make.

**How to apply:**

1. **Lead with your own reasoned pick.** When presenting options or a fork, open with «Recommend X, because <reason against goals / trade-offs>» — genuinely reasoned, not a neutral option-dump. The human still decides; a recommendation is not a usurpation. Do **not** hide behind reviewer-discipline §2 to avoid committing — that rule is for *true* strategy forks the reviewer cannot pick, not an excuse to dodge every call. *(codifies `reasoned_recommendation_default`)*
2. **Act when the best path is obvious; reserve questions for genuine forks.** When one next-step is clearly best on the merits (e.g. run the load-bearing probe before writing the PR; read the existing plan before recommending against it), just do it and say what you did. Reserve `AskUserQuestion` for forks you genuinely cannot resolve on the merits. An unnecessary clarifying question costs a round-trip and signals you did not reason it through. *(codifies `dont_ask_when_best_path_clear`)*

The two are one discipline from both ends — **commit to a reasoned position** rather than option-dumping (1) or over-asking (2). Boundary with reviewer-discipline §2: surface as decision-needed only when the options are *both legitimate and the call is the maintainer's project-strategy*; otherwise pick and proceed. Mechanical enforcement of (1) is blocked until the recommendation-detector recall is fixed (per #97/#98) — prose-only meanwhile. *(Distilled from memory entries codified per [memory-codification.md §3](memory-codification.md); DN-4 tracker rows #20/#27.)*

### §1.13 AI-doc research source priority (introduced 2026-05-22, DN-4 memory-codification)

For AI-documentation / agent-doc / goal-hierarchy research, **start the candidate sweep with the Tier-1 cutting-edge sources** — Claude Code (harness-native), AIF / aif-handoff, OhMyOpencode — *before* Anthropic's general «best-practices» pages. The fast-moving conventions live in the active companion projects; the evergreen docs lag the frontier. Refines §1.1-§1.5 candidate-surfacing for the AI-doc domain specifically (does not relax the ≥3-phrasing / 6-item checklist — it orders *where to look first*). *(codifies memory `ai_doc_research_priority_pool`; DN-4 tracker row #30.)*

## §2 Self-reflection prompts (retro Self-reflection block)

When writing the Self-reflection section of a phase retro that involved prior-art research, answer all five:

1. **Когда ошибся — почему?** Identify the specific moment a coverage gap was introduced (which lookup, which closure decision). Reconstruct the cognitive shortcut that closed analysis prematurely (cognitive anchor, semantic narrowness, prompt-list anchoring, treating own-stack as inert).
2. **Мог ли пропускать раньше?** Walk back through prior phases. Was the same shortcut available earlier? If yes — was it taken and missed, or taken and caught? This calibrates whether the gap is one-off or systemic.
3. **Как не пропускать?** Map the gap to one of §1's 6 checklist items. If it doesn't map, propose a 7th item (and surface it as a `research-patches/` entry per §3 below). The methodology is incomplete if real gaps fall outside it.
4. **Какой урок?** State the one-line takeaway in a form that becomes a search heuristic — not «be more careful», but «before closing X, also check Y». The lesson is operationalisable or it is not a lesson.
5. **Did the principle established in this phase apply to its own design choices?** If the phase introduced a new mechanism, format, or convention, audit whether that mechanism's discipline was applied to the phase's own work. Catches recursive-self-application gaps where the discipline operates bottom-up (corrective on later phases) but not top-down (preventive on its own design moment). *(Distilled from [Phase 8.8 SSOT-vs-ADR patch](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-08-phase-8.8-ssot-format-vs-adr.md) Prevention rule 3.)*

## §3 research-patches/ directory + AIF `/aif-evolve` precedent

Discovered coverage gaps land as standalone patches under [docs/meta-factory/research-patches/](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/), one file per gap. Format mirrors AIF `/aif-evolve` skill-context patches:

- **Problem** — what was missed and where (file + section + claim).
- **Root Cause** — which §1 checklist item failed (or 6th-item candidate per §2.3).
- **Solution** — what was changed to record the gap (commit reference, doc edit).
- **Prevention** — concrete PRIORITY CHECK rule that, if applied earlier, would have caught the gap. This is the load-bearing field; «be more careful» is rejected.
- **Tags** — ≥1 tag per failure mode (e.g. `#own-stack-blind-spot`, `#semantic-anchor`, `#prompt-list-anchoring`, `#negative-existence-claim`, `#category-sweep-missed`, `#recursive-self-application-gap`, `#scope-not-formal-trigger`, `#trigger-sweep`, `#recommendation-skips-own-discipline`).

Tags accumulate across patches. When a tag appears on ≥3 patches, distill its Prevention rules into [§1](#1-coverage-methodology-checklist-6-items) — the threshold is the same as AIF's «6/10 patches → priority-check rule» heuristic, scaled to our smaller corpus.

The AIF `/aif-evolve` precedent is what we mirror: per-incident patch + periodic distillation step + tag-keyed aggregation. Reflexion (Shinn et al.) is the theoretical backdrop — verbal-reinforcement memory across iterations — but `/aif-evolve` is the production-grade implementation we have direct access to and dogfood via the AIF dependency.

## §4 Anti-patterns

Pre-named for fast pattern-matching during retros. When a Self-reflection finding fits one of these, cite the anti-pattern by name in the patch's Root Cause field.

**Focus-tunnel family** — `#recursive-self-application-gap`, `#discipline-application-scope-blindness`, and candidate H7 «skill consumption blindness» share a common shape: AI agent applies discipline to the in-frame primary surface, blind to adjacent surfaces. They are siblings (not parent/child), differing in dimension — temporal (RSAG — phase forgets own rule), spatial (H8 — scope stops at primary object), mechanical (H7 candidate — auto-trigger keywords don't load the skill).

- **`#own-stack-blind-spot`** — treating an integrated dependency as inert infra, not a candidate analog. Particularly likely when the dependency was adopted in an earlier phase for an adjacent purpose.
- **`#semantic-anchor`** — anchoring on the surface vocabulary of the capability («ESLint rule», «recipe») rather than the function it performs («pick from menu given a codebase»). Search terms inherit the anchor and surface only same-vocabulary candidates.
- **`#prompt-list-anchoring`** — closing analysis at the prompt-listed candidate floor (typically 3-5) without applying §1.1-§1.5. The floor becomes the ceiling.
- **`#negative-existence-claim`** — accepting «no production tool implements X» without an adversarial counter-prompt. False negatives in production-tool surveys are common because tooling exists in adjacent paradigms (skill-context vs lint, agent vs IDE).
- **`#category-sweep-missed`** — closing without enumerating named-precedent categories the artifact could belong to. Especially common when the artifact is a *format* (SSOT, register, template) rather than a *capability* — bottom-up design slips past well-known precedents (ADR, MADR, fitness-functions table).
- **`#discipline-application-scope-blindness`** — discipline applied to the explicit object-under-review (a plan, recommendation, self-review patch), but **not** extended to: **(a) self-commentary lag** — annotations and inline comments in the same artefact describing primary content, left unchanged when primary content updates; **(b) meta-commentary lag** — meta-level documentation about deliverables (EXECUTION-PLAN summaries, PR retrospectives, tracker entries) that uses literal hard-coded counts/enumerations which self-deprecate as primary content extends; **(c) unverified collaborator claims** — factual assertions (file:line citations, counts, SHA references) received from collaborators, agent reports, or reviewer findings, accepted into edits without independent verification. Root cause: cognitive scope capture — discipline loads for whatever is «in frame» at the moment of analysis; commentary, meta-docs, and hand-off notes are structurally out of frame. Sibling of `#recursive-self-application-gap` and candidate H7 «skill consumption blindness» in the focus-tunnel family (different dimensions, not parent/child — see preface to §4). Countermeasures by sub-case: **(a)** treat inline annotations as first-order artefacts — apply same discipline pass as primary content; **(b)** use declarative forward-pointers («see §X for current count») rather than hard-coded literal counts/enumerations that self-deprecate on primary-content updates; **(c)** verify before accepting — for every file:line citation or factual assertion from a collaborator or agent report, confirm the cited line content against the actual file before applying the claim (T3 analogue for collaborator-sourced claims, per [ai-laziness-traps.md §2](ai-laziness-traps.md)). Occurrence corpus: Wave 0.5 (3 named occurrences + 2 sub-case (b) instances within one self-review cycle) — see [research-patches/2026-05-09-§13.21-l3-self-review.md §2.5](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-09-§13.21-l3-self-review.md) + promotion record [research-patches/2026-05-12-§13.24-h8-promotion.md](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-12-§13.24-h8-promotion.md).
- **`#recursive-self-application-gap`** — the discipline being established in a phase is not applied to that phase's own design choices. Catches shape «we forced future phases to do X but did not do X for our own X-introducing phase». Sibling of `#discipline-application-scope-blindness` in the focus-tunnel family (temporal dimension — see preface to §4). Surfaced via §2.5 self-reflection prompt.
- **`#scope-not-formal-trigger`** — a process gate (e.g. [§5.5 Step 1.5](../../docs/meta-factory/EXECUTION-PLAN.md)) is scoped to a specific phase shape (entry research) and does not fire on adjacent shapes (implementation phase format-decision moments). Coverage is procedurally compliant but methodologically incomplete.
- **`#trigger-sweep`** — push-based health-check anti-pattern: armed §13.x triggers sit indefinitely if no session does the sweep. The complement to pull-based discipline. Mitigation: §1.6.
- **`#adopted-pattern-drift`** — own-convention drift anti-pattern. Adopted external pattern (Arc42, AGENTS.md spec, AIF Step 0, Cline, matklad — see SSOT entries #6-#10) shifts at the source; project's adoption stays static; AI agents pattern-match on stale framing. Mitigation: SSOT velocity tags + 180-day staleness (slow patterns) / 90-day check (fast patterns) per [`prior-art-evaluations.md` entries #6-#10 «Trigger to revisit» lines](../../docs/meta-factory/prior-art-evaluations.md). Surfaces via `research-patches/YYYY-MM-DD-adopted-pattern-drift-<source>.md` on incidental observation; fold into systematic when L2 Research Agent ships per [open-questions.md §13.22](../../docs/meta-factory/open-questions.md).
- **`#recommendation-skips-own-discipline`** — recommendation introducing or extending a rule, principle, pattern, or discipline does not pass forward-check (compliance with existing R/principles/SSOT/triggers/doc-authority) and/or backward-check (complete sweep of existing artefacts under the new rule's scope). Same shape as `#recursive-self-application-gap` but scoped not to the project's code, but to the *act of forming the recommendation itself* — meta-cognitive blindspot where the agent of analysis is not also the object of analysis. Surfaced repeatedly across distinct sessions (PR #16 EXECUTION-PLAN drift; the «defer until consumer pain» reasoning anti-pattern across 4 turns of one session; L3 generated-docs research recommendation 2026-05-09). Mitigation: §1.7.
- **`#claim-from-memory-not-source`** — asserting a state-claim («X is done», «Wave N not closed», «local is live») from session recall or a stale working tree instead of the authoritative source (git / GitHub / decided-status docs); or reading diff direction from a `+`/`−` hunk rather than per-file content markers. The verify-against-source-of-truth family (4+ incidents). Mitigation: §1.11.
- **`#discipline-theatre`** — AI agent satisfies the *form* of a CI/discipline check (text length, file existence, regex match) without performing its *substance* (actual sweep, real verification, citation of evidence). Surfaces when a check is purely syntactic; mitigation requires paired-negative tests at the check's level (does the check FAIL when the discipline action is merely simulated?). Closed across Waves 8.1/8.2/8.3/8.4 for §1.7 sections, D-N enrollment completeness, §1.7 trailers, and Prior-art escape-hatches respectively. Bootstrap exemplar: research-patch [`2026-05-11-§13.29-substantive-compliance-research.md`](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-11-§13.29-substantive-compliance-research.md). Retroactive evidence corpus: [`2026-05-12-wave-8-retroactive-audit.md`](../../docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-12-wave-8-retroactive-audit.md).
