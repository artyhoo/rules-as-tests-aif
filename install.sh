#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — Deploy rules-as-tests-aif into the current project.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh ts-server                      # default safe install
#   ./install.sh react-next --force             # overwrite existing files
#   ./install.sh react-next --dry-run           # preview without writing
#   ./install.sh react-next --dry-run --force   # preview overwrite plan
#   ./install.sh ts-server --full               # also auto-install dev-deps (no prompts; stack required)
#   ./setup -y ts-server                        # recommended one-shot path (wrapper: --full + companions)
#   ./install.sh ts-server --wire-ci            # also auto-wire missing CI gates via yq (opt-in, detect-first)
#
# What it does:
#   1. Copies skills/ + .claude/skills/{pipeline,dispatcher,aif-doctor,template-audit}/ → .claude/skills/
#      (the meta-orchestrator pipeline + its orchestration companions are shipped from
#       .claude/skills/ as single source of truth; self-reflection + ai-doc are intentionally
#       NOT shipped — repo-internal per build-first-reuse-default.md §1.1 shipped-axis;
#       cross-refs to repo-internal paths get sed-transformed to GitHub blob URLs —
#       see UPSTREAM_BLOB_URL + transform_internal_refs() below;
#       per .claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md §7 SSOT)
#   2. Copies agents/  → .claude/agents/
#   3. Copies factory templates → .ai-factory/  (templates: as-is, you fill in placeholders)
#   4. Copies packages/core/audit-self/ + packages/preset-*/audit-self/ → scripts/
#   5. Copies packages/core/templates/shared/ + packages/preset-*/templates/ → project root
#
# Safety: by default never overwrites existing files. Use --force to overwrite.
# Use --dry-run to preview the plan without touching disk.
# Use --full to also run the consumer's package manager to install the dev-deps the shipped
# hooks/scripts need (default is to ask [y/N], default No — a mutating step is opt-in).
# Use --wire-ci to also auto-wire any CI-orphan rule-enforcement gate (§6c) into your existing
# workflow via yq (used-if-present, never installed by us; default is the non-destructive WARN +
# paste-block — wiring edits your kept workflow in place, so it is opt-in). No effect in --dry-run.

# ─── Pre-install: verify shipped artefacts carry Authoritative-for headers ──
# Author-side fail-loud check (Wave 3 of §13.21 closure, see
# docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-09-§13.21-l3-revision.md).
# Mirrors the canonical list at
# packages/core/principles/09-doc-authority-hierarchy.test.ts
# (REQUIRED_HEADER_DOCS Wave 2 + Wave 5.1 + memory-codification-auditor + orchestrator-worker-discipline — 18 shipped surfaces).
# Runs in --dry-run too, so preview also catches drift between PR-side
# (principle 09 CI) and release-time copy. Positioned before package.json
# check + stack picker so framework-author drift fails fastest, before any
# interactive prompt.
# SHIPPED_DOCS is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for both the header-verify loop (below) AND the
# §3 skill-context copy step (which derives its skill-context entries from this very array —
# see the `*/skill-context/*/SKILL.md` case there). Adding a skill-context doc here wires it
# into verify AND deploy in one edit → the two lists cannot drift (FQA S1-A P2: aif-orchestrator-
# discipline was header-verified but absent from the hand-maintained copy step, so consumers
# landed 2/3). Keep all three skill-context entries listed explicitly (static-parseable by
# principle 09's SHIPPED_DOCS↔REQUIRED_HEADER_DOCS check).
