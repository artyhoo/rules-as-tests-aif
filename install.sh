#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — Deploy rules-as-tests-aif into the current project.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh ts-server                      # default safe install
#   ./install.sh react-next --force             # overwrite existing files
#   ./install.sh react-next --dry-run           # preview without writing
#   ./install.sh react-next --dry-run --force   # preview overwrite plan
#
# What it does:
#   1. Copies skills/ + .claude/skills/pipeline/ → .claude/skills/
#      (meta-orchestrator is shipped from .claude/skills/ as single source of truth;
#       cross-refs to repo-internal paths get sed-transformed to GitHub blob URLs —
#       see UPSTREAM_BLOB_URL + transform_internal_refs() below;
#       per .claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md §7 SSOT)
#   2. Copies agents/  → .claude/agents/
#   3. Copies factory templates → .ai-factory/  (templates: as-is, you fill in placeholders)
#   4. Copies packages/core/audit-self/ + packages/preset-*/audit-self/ → scripts/
#   5. Copies packages/core/templates/shared/ + packages/preset-*/templates/ → project root
#
# Safety: by default never overwrites existing files. Use --force to overwrite.
# Use --dry-run to preview the plan without touching disk.

# ─── Pre-install: verify shipped artefacts carry Authoritative-for headers ──
# Author-side fail-loud check (Wave 3 of §13.21 closure, see
# docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-09-§13.21-l3-revision.md).
# Mirrors the canonical list at
# packages/core/principles/09-doc-authority-hierarchy.test.ts
# (REQUIRED_HEADER_DOCS Wave 2 + Wave 5.1 + memory-codification-auditor + v3 manual-rule-liveness-prober — 18 shipped surfaces).
# Runs in --dry-run too, so preview also catches drift between PR-side
# (principle 09 CI) and release-time copy. Positioned before package.json
# check + stack picker so framework-author drift fails fastest, before any
# interactive prompt.
# SHIPPED_DOCS is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for both the header-verify loop (below) AND the
# §3 skill-context copy step (which derives its skill-context entries from this very array —
# see the `*/skill-context/*/SKILL.md` case there). Adding a skill-context doc here wires it
# into verify AND deploy in one edit → the two lists cannot drift (FQA S1-A P2: aif-orchestrator-
# discipline was header-verified but absent from the hand-maintained copy step, so consumers
# landed 2/3). Keep all three skill-context entries listed explicitly (static-parseable by
# principle 09's SHIPPED_DOCS↔REQUIRED_HEADER_DOCS check).

# ─── 7. package.json scripts (FQA S1-A W4) ──────────────
# install.sh historically left scripts as a manual INSTALL.md §3 step, so consumers landed
# `scripts: {}` while AGENTS.md + the shipped ci.yml call `npm run lint/typecheck/arch:check/
# test:*` → every gate failed "Missing script". Inject the canonical block (non-destructive:
# only adds keys the consumer lacks). The referenced devDependencies (eslint, dependency-cruiser,
# stryker, npm-run-all2, vitest, prettier, husky) are NOT installed here — that is the consumer's
# `npm install` + residual R-2 (devDeps manifest). Scripts present ≠ runnable until deps land,
# but "Missing script" → "tool not installed" is the intended, INSTALL.md-documented path.
