# C-1 agent-collision resolution (2026-05-20, research-patches/2026-05-20-agent-collision-resolution.md):
#   - best-practices-sidecar — KEEP-AIF: removed from our payload; AIF's rules-sidecar
#     (reads .ai-factory/RULES.md) + edit-time ESLint + pre-push are the real enforcers.
#   - docs-auditor — RENAMED to living-docs-auditor (de-collides with AIF's same-named agent).
#   - review-sidecar — still collides with AIF's. copy_safe DEFAULT (no --force) intentionally
#     SKIPS it when AIF's is present (AIF keeps its slot). Do NOT --force-overwrite it: that
#     would strip AIF frontmatter the implement-coordinator + aif-handoff pipeline depend on.
#     Instead our anti-tautology content is delivered into AIF's pipeline via the native
#     .ai-factory/skill-context/aif-review/SKILL.md override (copied in §3 below). The live
#     CC-dispatch probe (former DECISION-NEEDED #2) is RESOLVED: a background maxTurns:6
#     sidecar reads + applies skill-context (3/3 read, 2/2 apply) — SSOT #50, ADOPT.
#     agents/review-sidecar.md remains the portable SSOT (@dual-pair anchor: review-sidecar).
