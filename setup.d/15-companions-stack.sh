# setup.d/15-companions-stack.sh — Stack-specific companion selection layer (S3).
#
# Reads companions.manifest, detects the current stack from package.json signals,
# and reports which companions are relevant for the detected stack.
# This layer provides the static stack-aware selection; the actual installs are
# performed by the setup wrapper's companion loop (engine.sh).
#
# Stack signals (package.json):
#   react-next   → next package present
#   react-spa    → react present, no next
#   react-native → react-native present
#   ts-server    → typescript present, no react/next (default for TS projects)
#
# Sources: lib.sh (already in dispatcher scope)
# S0 rows: NEW-layers table, O7
# Depends on: lib.sh (already in dispatcher scope), companions.manifest
# @cc-only-rationale: sourced by install.sh dispatcher, not standalone
# R1 hard gate: no AIF-engine mapping, no live registry call — static table only (umbrella §9).

# Stack detection lives in lib.sh (_detect_stack_from_pkg) — SSOT shared with the install.sh
# stack-pick (GH #780 fresh-install auto-detect). lib.sh is sourced before this layer (install.sh
# sources lib.sh at the top, then the numbered layers), so the function is in scope here. The
# detector is node-free (grep-based) per the install-time node-optional repo-read model.
