# setup.d/80-rule-bootstrap.sh — rule-bootstrapping install-time step (LIVE-or-degrade).
#
# Runs the rule-bootstrapping pipeline on the consumer from the LIVE research+selection files
# the human's interactive agent session authored (agents/rule-researcher.md → two committed
# JSON files), through the deterministic factory:
#   FileResearchClient + FileGenerateClient → generate.ts factory → install() → rules-lock.json
# Payload: packages/core/install/rule-bootstrap-cli.ts (the shared entry). This step is the
# Option-1 gate placement — a standalone setup.d step, mirroring 05-mcp.sh's FULL gate (the
# placement fork the spike parked per kickoff §6; resolved to Option 1 at harvest time).
#
# Gated on FULL ("--full" carrier, install.sh:57+64) so the non-full / snapshot path no-ops
# → byte-identical guarantee preserved. $0-in-CI (principle 17): the consume path is a pure
# file-read (the live MCP research already happened in the human session); the CI self-install
# path never sets FULL. Degrades on absence (no node / missing CLI / no research files) and
# never aborts install (rc=0).
#
# Decision B: research artefacts ABSENT → degrade + guidance, ship no rule (NEVER the stub on the
# consumer path). The stub stays the CI/test default injection only (rule-bootstrap.ts). #183.
#
# @cc-only-rationale: sourced by install.sh dispatcher, not standalone; install-time
#   orchestration in consumer context after --full dep-install.

# Gate: rule-bootstrapping only runs on the --full / yes pass.
