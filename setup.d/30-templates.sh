# Seed tool-decisions.md so the deps-change re-evaluation hook actually fires (FQA S1-B P1:
# deps-hash-check.sh short-circuits to silent exit 0 when this file is absent — on the ./setup
# path nothing ever created it, so the whole automation was dead). The template carries the
# `deps-hash: <pending>` sentinel (DN-1 = Option B): the hook WARNs every session until the
# consumer runs /tool-bootstrapping once, which stamps the real hash. file-deploy only (kind
# identical to the seeds above) — no npm/package.json dependency at install time.
# CONCERN: S3 tool-bootstrap — this seeds the tool-decisions.md template, which is a file-deploy.
# The actual tool-bootstrapping workflow (picking tools, recording decisions) is a separate S3 concern.
