# _detect_stack_from_pkg — classify the consumer's stack from package.json dependency signals.
# Pure bash + grep, NODE-FREE: install.sh runs BEFORE the consumer installs deps, so this must not
# depend on `node` being present (node-optional install-time repo-read model — same posture as
# detect_pm above, packages/core/audit-self/detect-r2-boundary.sh, and the expo-detect in
# setup.d/40-configs.sh, all of which read package.json with grep, not node).
# SSOT — this is the single stack detector; both the install.sh stack-pick (fresh `--yes`/`--full`
# auto-detect, GH #780) and 15-companions-stack.sh consume it, so the signal logic never drifts.
# Signal order is most-specific-first: react-native → next → react → typescript → unknown.
# The grep anchor '"<dep>"[[:space:]]*:' matches a package.json dependency KEY exactly (the closing
# quote excludes prefixes — '"react"' does NOT match '"react-native":' / '"react-dom":', and a
# string VALUE like "next build" is not matched — there is no '"next":' key there).
# Trade-off vs a node deps-only parse: grep scans the WHOLE file, so a signal key in
# peer/optional/overrides (or, rarely, a same-named "scripts" key) also counts. For a realistic
# consumer package.json this is equal-or-more-inclusive and never the #780 "silent wrong install"
# failure (an app peer-depending on next is next-related); the install path fail-louds only on
# `unknown`, never on a mis-detect.
# Reads <target>/package.json (target defaults to $PROJECT_ROOT). Echoes exactly one of:
#   react-native | react-next | react-spa | ts-server | unknown
# I-2 (§13.5): the optional <target> arg lets the per-workspace walk (_detect_stacks_per_workspace)
# classify each workspace dir; the no-arg form is unchanged (back-compat — the I-1 install stack-pick
