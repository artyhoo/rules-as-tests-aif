# test:*` → every gate failed "Missing script". Inject the canonical block (non-destructive:
# only adds keys the consumer lacks). The referenced devDependencies (eslint, dependency-cruiser,
# stryker, npm-run-all2, vitest, prettier, husky) are NOT installed here — that is the consumer's
# `npm install` + residual R-2 (devDeps manifest). Scripts present ≠ runnable until deps land,
# but "Missing script" → "tool not installed" is the intended, INSTALL.md-documented path.

# `npx lint-staged`) fired with their tools ABSENT → ENOENT on the consumer's first commit (#478
# root, #483). Close it: detect the consumer's PM (detect_pm SSOT) and actually RUN the dev-dep
# install so the declared tools land before that first commit. Mutating + opinionated → OPT-IN:
# interactive [y/N] default-No, or --full to skip the prompt (non-interactive without --full → No).
# Shells out to the consumer's own PM — adds NO dependency to the framework (per §3 scope fence /
# BFR). DEVDEPS is the single source for both the install command and the Next-steps fallback echo
# (so "what we install" and "what we tell you to install" can't drift — #two-prompts-drift).
