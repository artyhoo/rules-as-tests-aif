# meta-orchestrator + its orchestration companions: shipped from authoring location
# .claude/skills/ as single source of truth (no separate mirror under skills/). Repo-internal
# cross-refs in .md files get rewritten to GitHub blob URLs via transform_internal_refs().
#   - pipeline      — the planner (/pipeline): umbrella triage, priority ranking, plan/state.md.
#   - dispatcher    — pipeline's execution companion: dispatches a chosen umbrella's stages
#                     through the aif-control loop the ./setup runtime-bridge step installs.
#   - aif-doctor    — diagnoses that same aif-handoff runtime when a task stalls / runtime breaks.
#   - template-audit — local advisory audit of the rendered templates this installer ships.
# self-reflection + ai-doc are intentionally NOT shipped: they are repo-internal (reference
# THIS repo's rules / docs paths a consumer does not have) — see the build-vs-reuse shipped-axis
# default in .claude/rules/build-first-reuse-default.md §1.1 + dual-implementation-discipline.md §3.
