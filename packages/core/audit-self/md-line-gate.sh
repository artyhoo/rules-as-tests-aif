# md-line-gate.sh — markdown overweight gate (≤600 lines) with declared-transient
# exemptions. Single source for the audit-self CI "No file > 500 lines (markdown)"
# step (.github/workflows/audit-self.yml); extracted from inline YAML so the gate
# is unit-testable (cross-session kickoff portability I-phase, SSOT #116 — the
# kickoff exemption ships with a paired positive+negative test, no discipline-theatre).
#
# Exemptions (each per-file/glob exemption requires an in-file "transient artifact"
# marker in the first 20 lines; directory-level audit-trail accumulators do not):
#   - EXEMPT (per-file):  docs/meta-factory/EXECUTION-PLAN.md   (transient pre-1.0 plan)
#   - EXEMPT_DIRS:        docs/meta-factory/research-patches/    (evidence accumulator,
#                         length ∝ investigation depth)
#   - kickoffs (glob):    .claude/orchestrator-prompts/*/kickoff.md  (committed durable
#                         design docs; may exceed 600 lines IFF marked — SSOT #116)
#
# Usage: md-line-gate.sh [<root-dir>]   (default root = ".")
# Exit 0 = every markdown file within the 600-line limit (or exempt); exit 1 =
# at least one overweight non-exempt file. GitHub `::notice`/`::error` annotations
# are emitted for the Actions log.
