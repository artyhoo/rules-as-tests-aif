# check-kickoff-portability.sh — D5: fail-loud that an IN-FLIGHT umbrella's
# kickoff.md is git-tracked (and therefore portable to another machine/container).
# Cross-session kickoff portability I-phase, SSOT #116.
#
# "Committed only when the author remembers" is a memory-dependent convention —
# the exact thing the project goal forbids ([README.md#why-this-exists]). This
# check makes portability a property verified at the earliest reachable channel
# (pre-push), not a habit.
#
# An umbrella trips the check when ALL of:
#   - .claude/orchestrator-prompts/<u>/kickoff.md exists ON DISK, AND
#   - it is NOT listed by `git ls-files` (untracked → invisible on machine B), AND
#   - the umbrella has NO done.md (i.e. still in-flight; a closed umbrella never trips).
#
# Calibration: warn-only by default (peer to the §1.7 trailer rollout). Set
# KICKOFF_PORTABILITY_WARN_ONLY=false to flip to a hard fail once the back-catalog
# is migrated (PR-2).
#
# No-ops in repos without .claude/orchestrator-prompts (consumers — out of scope).
#
# Seams (tests): REPO_ROOT, KICKOFF_PORTABILITY_WARN_ONLY.
# @cc-only-rationale: pre-push repo-hygiene gate (maintainer repo); no portable
#   equivalent fires at the same moment, and consumers ship no orchestrator-prompts.
