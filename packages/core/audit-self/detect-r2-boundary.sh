# detect-r2-boundary.sh — C1 of install auto-wire R2 (GH #547 Point 2).
#
# Classifies a repo into exactly one R2-boundary verdict by READING it (pure bash + find/grep, no
# node/eslint). The installer (C2, install.sh §6b-bis) and BOTH inertness gates (C4: check-rule-
# globs.sh + check-rule-enforced.sh via r2-na-marker.sh) consume the verdict to decide whether R2
# must be wired, may be recorded N/A, or stays the red alarm.
#
# Verdicts (the FIRST stdout line is exactly one of):
#   boundary-present       — a manual-parse HTTP boundary exists: ≥1 file under a RULE_GLOBS.boundary
#                            token folder (handlers/routes/controllers/app·api/actions) OR a zod parse
#                            call (`.safeParse(` anywhere, or `<ident>.parse(` where <ident> ∉
#                            JSON/Date/Number/parseInt/parseFloat) in NON-TEST source. R2 must be
#                            active. Subsequent `glob:<pattern>` lines list the covering globs the
#                            installer should ensure RULE_GLOBS.boundary holds.
#   no-boundary-confident  — declarative-validation framework (allowlist) present AND zero boundary
#                            signals. Safe to record a conditional R2 N/A.
#   ambiguous              — anything else. Stay red (today's behaviour). No auto-green on doubt.
#
# Conservative invariant (LOAD-BEARING): no-boundary-confident requires a POSITIVE allowlist match
# AND zero boundary signals. Every uncertain case degrades to `ambiguous`. A false `no-boundary-
# confident` (silently un-guarding a real boundary) is therefore structurally unlikely; the worst
# realistic outcome is a false `ambiguous` (a red the human reconciles) — the same cost as today.
#
# Exit: always 0 (a classifier, not a gate). The verdict is on stdout.

# anchor would MISS idiomatic zod (`z.object({…}).parse(req)`) and produce a false N/A that silently
