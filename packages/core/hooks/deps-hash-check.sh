# @dual-pair: deps-hash-check-dogfood
# spec: packages/core/hooks/deps-hash-check.sh — packages/ copy is the SOURCE shipped by
# install.sh:261; .claude/ copy is this repo's dogfood instance wired in settings.json.
# The two are kept byte-identical; drift is guarded by deps-hash-check.test.ts (#382 §6).
# Consumer-facing UserPromptSubmit hook — D7=a (Wave 5.3).
# Compares sha256 of current package.json deps against deps-hash stored in
# .ai-factory/tool-decisions.md. On mismatch → prints one-line WARN to stdout
# (Claude Code harness injects stdout into session context automatically).
# Always exits 0 — non-blocking, context injection only.
#
# Register in consumer's .claude/settings.json:
#   "UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"bash .claude/hooks/deps-hash-check.sh"}]}]
