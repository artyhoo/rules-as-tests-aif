# aif-review skill-context — anti-tautology two-AI review conventions

> **Authoritative for:** project-specific review conventions injected into AI Factory's `aif-review` skill (and its background `review-sidecar`) — the anti-tautology / two-AI test-review checks this project requires in addition to AIF's generic review.
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see the consumer's README.md. The generic correctness/security/performance review — that stays owned by AIF's `aif-review` SKILL.md; this file augments it.

<!-- @dual-pair: review-sidecar -->
<!-- spec-of: agents/review-sidecar.md -->
<!-- Portable SSOT for this content is agents/review-sidecar.md. This file is the AIF-native
     delivery channel (skill-context override) for the same anti-tautology spec, per
     .claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md §7. Edit the SSOT first, then mirror here. -->

This project has learned, from repeated incidents, that the highest-value review signal is **test quality**, not just code correctness. AIF's generic review already covers correctness / security / performance; the conventions below are what this project additionally requires. Apply them as project-level overrides — when they add a check AIF's defaults don't have, perform that check and include it in the output.

## Review the diff as a cold external reviewer

Read the changed code as if you had never seen it and did **not** write it. The implementer wrote the code and its tests in one head — same blind spots. Your value is being a different head. Be skeptical of comments and commit messages; read the actual diff.

## MUST additionally check — test quality

1. **Tautological tests** — assertions true by construction (test nothing real). For each `expect(...)` in the diff, ask: _"if I removed this assertion, what bug could now ship?"_ If the answer is "none", flag it. Common shapes: `expect(result).toBeDefined()` when the return type is already non-optional; `expect(typeof x).toBe('string')` when the type guarantees it; asserting against the same computation the SUT uses (`items.reduce(...)` mirrored in both); `expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled()` with no assertion on arguments or resulting side effect; React `toBeInTheDocument()` / `toBeEnabled()` with no follow-up behavioral assertion.

2. **Mock-only tests** — the test verifies a mock was called but not the **outcome** that should follow (returned shape, emitted event, reserved inventory, sent email). Flag.

3. **Missing edge cases** — for each public function in the diff, confirm tests cover empty input (`[]`/`''`/`{}`/`null`/`undefined`), boundary values (0, max, just-above/below threshold), error paths, and racy/concurrent paths where applicable. Happy-path-only on a new function → flag MAJOR.

4. **Test name ≠ behaviour** — names must describe asserted behaviour ("returns 401 when token is missing"), not mechanics ("test 1", "works", "checks user").

5. **Test independence** — module-level mutable state without `beforeEach` reset, FS/DB writes without cleanup, missing `vi.clearAllMocks()`. Tests must run in any order.

6. **React / Next anti-patterns** (`.tsx`/`.jsx`) — `<div onClick>` instead of `<button>`; icon buttons without `aria-label`; `key={i}` in dynamic lists; `useEffect` missing deps; `{count && <X/>}` rendering "0"; `<a href>` for internal links instead of `<Link>`; `<img>` instead of `next/image`; client-only work in Server Components and server-only imports in Client Components.

7. **React testing anti-patterns** — `fireEvent.click` instead of `userEvent.click`; `getByTestId` where `getByRole` works; stray `screen.debug()`; redundant `act()` around `userEvent`.

## Output augmentation

In addition to AIF's standard review summary, include a section `### Test-Quality Review` listing each finding as: severity (`BLOCKER` correctness/data-integrity incl. tautological test on a critical path / `MAJOR` anti-pattern at scale / `MINOR` style), `file:line`, "what I saw", "why it's a problem", and a concrete one-line fix. One issue per finding; do not bundle. Report only — never modify code.
