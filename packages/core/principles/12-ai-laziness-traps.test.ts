/**
 * Principle 12 — ai-laziness-traps kickoff citation enforcement
 *
 * Source: .claude/rules/ai-laziness-traps.md §3 (kickoff-author obligations)
 *         docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-05-16-prose-rules-audit-research.md §3.1
 *         (Track 3 evidence-based probe confirming BUILD verdict; principle 10 precedent)
 *
 * Invariant: every REAL (non-symlink) kickoff.md file under
 * .claude/orchestrator-prompts/<dir>/ (excluding pre-rule exempt dirs AND
 * coordination mirrors — symlinks into $CANON authored in another worktree, see
 * isCoordinationMirror) must satisfy the COMPOUND CITATION CHECK:
 * at least ONE of the following must be present —
 *   (a) string "ai-laziness-traps" anywhere in the file (explicit rule citation)
 *   (b) pattern **T\d+** (bold Markdown T-number reference)
 *   (c) "Active traps" or "Active.*T\d+" section header
 *   (d) domain-specific T-label pattern "T-[A-Z]+-[A-Z]"
 *
 * A file that fails ALL four checks is a §3 violation: it names no traps and
 * cites no rule — equivalent to the #trap-catalogue-blanket-reference anti-pattern
 * (treating the catalogue as decoration rather than discipline).
 *
 * EXEMPT_LIST: kickoffs created before 2026-05-12 (when ai-laziness-traps.md
 * was added). No git dates available (files are gitignored); exemption is
 * maintained as an explicit list rather than a date filter.
