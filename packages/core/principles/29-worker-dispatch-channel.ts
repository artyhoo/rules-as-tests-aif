/**
 * Principle 29 — shared matcher for `#worker-dispatch-via-subagent` (M6).
 *
 * Single source of truth (dual-implementation-discipline.md §7): this module
 * holds the ONE matcher. Both enforcement channels call it — never two divergent
 * copies (anti-pattern `#two-prompts-drift`):
 *   - edit-time hook  → .claude/hooks/check-worker-dispatch-channel.sh
 *                       (delegates to 29-worker-dispatch-channel.bin.ts → this module)
 *   - CI principle    → 29-worker-dispatch-channel.test.ts (imports this module)
 *
 * @dual-pair: channel-discipline-worker-dispatch
 *
 * Rule enforced (.claude/skills/pipeline/SKILL.md §5 `#worker-dispatch-via-subagent`):
 * a WRITE-task Worker must NOT be dispatched via the Agent tool / a subagent from
 * the meta-orchestrator session. The Agent tool is ONLY for Phase -1 read-only
 * reviewers + read-only research subagents (text return). Write-task Workers run as
 * a fresh maintainer-opened session (a pasted §10 1-liner) or via dispatch.ts.
 *
 * Spec: docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-06-27-meta-orch-channel-discipline-mechanism.md
 *       §0/§3/§4 (M6 design, candidate matrix, regex sketch, escape-token).
 *
 * Honest ceiling (spec §0 + §4 caveat 1): this is a kickoff-TEXT gate. It fires on
 * a kickoff whose PROSE instructs Agent-tool write-dispatch (the documented Stage-5
 * incident class). It does NOT catch a session that merely PERFORMS Agent-tool
 * write-dispatch at runtime without writing it into a kickoff — the rule's own
 * falsifier reads «who invokes, not what the prompt looks like». A real upgrade
 * from Class C, not a complete enforcement of the rule.
 *
 * Slot 29 rationale: slots 01-28 occupied as of 2026-06-27.

/**
 * Clause (a) — names the Agent-tool WRITE-DISPATCH channel.
 *
 * TUNED from the spec §4 sketch (documented per spec §4 "matcher over-match →
 * tune + document"). The sketch's clause (a) was
 *   /Agent[ -]tool|via .*Agent|isolation:\s*["']?worktree/
 * but the trailing `isolation: worktree` alternative is NOT a signal of the
 * Agent-tool channel — worktree isolation is the LEGITIMATE execution environment
 * of both Mode A inline sessions and Mode B worktree Workers (see
 * .claude/skills/pipeline/SKILL.md §5 dispatch tree). On the live tree it was the
 * SOLE cause of 8 false positives on legitimate kickoffs (Mode A inline / Worker's
 * own worktree), e.g. `Mode A inline Opus Worker ... isolation: "worktree"`.
 * The actual discriminator is the Agent-tool DISPATCH channel — which the §1
 * ground-truth fixture still matches via "Agent tool". Dropping the worktree
 * alternative therefore removes 8 FPs while keeping the fixture firing; the §2
 * deliverable's own prose for clause (a) is "names the Agent-tool write-dispatch
 * channel", which worktree isolation does not satisfy. Fork recorded in PR notes.
