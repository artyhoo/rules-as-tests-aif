#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bridge-cleanup.sh — nuke the test/probe junk the bridge accrues each session.
#
# WHY (qloop-ux-probe 2026-06-01): probe/smoke runs leave orphan aif tasks,
# /tmp ManualBackend kickoffs, and dedup-store cruft behind every session. This
# is the one-command sweep so it stops piling up. It deletes ONLY clearly-test
# artefacts (title matches the test allowlist); real work is never touched.
#
# Targets (all opt-out via flags):
#   - aif tasks whose title matches the TEST allowlist (UXPROBE / smoke / probe)
#   - /tmp/runtime-bridge-*.md  (ManualBackend kickoffs) older than KEEP_DAYS
#   - /tmp/runtime-bridge-dedup.jsonl.bak-*  (manual backups)
#   - container git junk ALREADY MERGED into origin/staging: retained per-task
#     worktrees + their feature/* branches (§4). Enabling per-task worktrees
#     (parallel_enabled, research-patch 2026-06-01-aif-task-isolation.md §2.1)
#     makes aif RETAIN worktrees post-terminal — this section is the standing
#     sweep so they self-clean, completing the #359 "no manual/AI sweep" principle.
#
# It does NOT touch: the live dedup store, UNMERGED container git state (unmerged
# branches/worktrees are PRESERVED — real in-flight work; a container stash is
# REPORTED, never dropped — that is the operator's git), real tasks. §4 removes
# ONLY branches/worktrees merged into origin/staging (their work is in the trunk),
# double-guarded by `git branch --merged` filtering + `git branch -d` (which itself
# refuses to delete an unmerged branch). This is operator/co-located tooling
# (docker exec); a portable fix is upstream auto-removal of retained worktrees.

# ── 4. Prune MERGED container git junk (retained worktrees + feature branches) ─

# --merged` filters to merged only, and `git branch -d` itself refuses to delete
# an unmerged branch (belt + braces). Enabling per-task worktrees makes aif retain
# them post-terminal (research-patch 2026-06-01-aif-task-isolation.md §2.1); this
# is the standing sweep that keeps them from piling up.

# prune / branch -d in the SHARED .git, which a running task's ref-updating git ops also touch
# (shared ref + packed-refs locks; amplified by parallel_enabled keeping multiple tasks active).
# A collision yields "cannot lock ref" and can fail a live task's git step. So skip §4 entirely
# while any non-terminal task exists. Deterministic, no AI. Fail-open (count unknown → 0 → proceed):
# §4 is already safe-by-construction (merged-only), so this guard is defence-in-depth, not the
# primary safety — worst case of a false 0 is a transient lock retry, never corruption or data loss.
