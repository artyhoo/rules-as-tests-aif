# Paired-negative for the runtime-bridge auto-dispatch opt-IN gate
# (.claude/hooks/runtime-bridge-dispatch.sh) — one-click-installer kickoff §7,
# maintainer decision 2026-05-31: auto-dispatch is real, metered autonomous
# work, so the hook must NOT fire on every */kickoff.md write (the old opt-OUT
# default was a paid-by-default footgun). Default = NO dispatch; ONLY a kickoff
# whose FIRST line is exactly `<!-- bridge: auto -->` (trimmed match, mirroring
# the kickoff.ts skip-marker precedent) auto-dispatches.
#
# Cases:
#   (a) NEGATIVE   — unmarked */kickoff.md            → no dispatch (the guard)
#   (b) POSITIVE   — `<!-- bridge: auto -->` first line → dispatch fires
#                    (positive control proving (a) is non-vacuous)
#   (c) REGRESSION — *-meta-launch/kickoff.md WITH marker → still skipped
#                    (pipeline-ux P4 path filter must survive the gate)
#
# tsx is stubbed via PATH-prepend (echoes DISPATCH-CALLED); jq/node presence is
# asserted up front because the hook's dependency guard exits 0 silently when
# they are absent — (a)/(c) would then pass vacuously with no dispatch leg at all.
#
# CI: invoked from .github/workflows/audit-self.yml#principles-meta-tests
# (alongside prepush-fallback-base-ref.test.sh).
