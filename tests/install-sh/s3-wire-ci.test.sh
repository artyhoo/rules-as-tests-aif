# universalization-fix-s3 Stage P — opt-in `--wire-ci` yq auto-wirer (GH #521).
#
# Context. The HYBRID verdict (research-patch 2026-06-14-s3-workflow-merge-adopt-vs-build.md, SSOT
# #117) has two halves: (BUILD) the broadened, non-destructive CI-orphan WARN + paste-block — already
# shipped and covered by r2-glob-reach.test.sh #1; and (REFERENCE) this opt-in `--wire-ci` path, which —
# only on explicit consent and only if `yq` is present — idempotently appends the missing
# rule-enforcement gates into the consumer's kept workflow. THIS test covers the REFERENCE half.
#
# Paired-negative discipline (principle 02-paired-negative-test):
#   • POS (yq arm): --wire-ci appends all 4 missing gates, suppresses the WARN, and is idempotent.
#   • NEG (load-bearing, runs everywhere): WITHOUT --wire-ci the consumer's workflow is left
#     BYTE-IDENTICAL — proving the auto-wire is genuinely opt-in and the default stays non-destructive.
#
# Option B — yq-absent install-offer (companion-install-principle.md §1/§3). When yq is ABSENT but the
# consumer consented (--wire-ci), the installer OFFERS yq's official installer (detect-first, unpinned,
# TTY-gated [y/N]) instead of immediately falling back to the paste-block. None of the arms below ever
# install yq for real (CI must not mutate the host or flake), so they exercise the *non-installing*
# Option-B sub-branches only:
#   • OPT-B DECLINE (load-bearing): yq absent + non-interactive (--wire-ci, stdin </dev/null). Whatever
#     installer the host has, the SAFE-DEGRADE invariant must hold: nothing installed, workflow BYTE-
#     IDENTICAL, a 'yq not installed' message + installer/manual guidance + the paste-block, exit 0.
#     Self-SKIPs if the host happens to ship yq (the POS arm covers the present path).
#   • OPT-B OFFER-REACHED (best-effort, fake-snap stub): on a host with no yq and no brew, a stubbed
#     `snap` on PATH proves Option B ROUTES by name to 'sudo snap install yq' (the stub is only NAMED,
#     never executed). Self-SKIPs where brew is present (DECLINE already asserts 'brew install yq').
#
# yq availability: GitHub-hosted runners ship `yq`, so CI exercises the POS arm. A local run without
# yq prints an explicit SKIP (never a silent pass). Comment preservation is OBSERVED, not asserted:
# yq's comment handling is best-effort (verdict §4 Q1 / §6 C-A — the exact reason it is DISQUALIFIED as
# the *silent* default); hard-gating a best-effort property would contradict the verdict and make CI
# flaky, so we report it as evidence toward the verdict's falsifier-(a) instead of failing on it.
