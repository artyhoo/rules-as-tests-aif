# cih-s2 F8b — "RuleCreator doc-URL honesty" (same defect class as F13, react-next stack).
# Several shipped/source artefacts pointed their policy doc-URLs at `factory/RULES*.md` —
# a path that does NOT exist in this repo (the real homes are
# `packages/preset-next-15-canonical/RULES.md` and `…/RULES.react-next.md`). A consumer
# clicking the link, or any drift check resolving it, lands on a 404 → "documents lie out
# of the box". F13 (S1) fixed the 3 CORE eslint rules; F8b finishes the residue:
#   • 3 preset (react-next) eslint RuleCreator URLs  → …/RULES.react-next.md  (SHIPPED to consumers)
#   • rules-manifest.json R2 + R11 `policy` refs      → …/RULES.md            (repo-internal SSOT)
#   • .github/workflows/workflow-integrity.yml comment→ …/RULES.md            (framework-internal)
# (The kickoff named only the R11 manifest ref; R2 at line 40 is the identical defect in the
#  same file — fixing one and leaving the other would be a vacuous half-fix, so both are asserted.)
#
# The invariant: NO in-scope artefact references the non-existent `factory/RULES` path.
#
# PAIRED-NEGATIVE (umbrella discipline): each pos arm has a neg arm that re-introduces the
# exact dead `factory/RULES` path and re-runs the SAME grep — it MUST flip to a hit. A neg
# that does not bite means the pos check was vacuous → reported as bad.
#
# Runs the REAL pipeline for the shipped arm: installs react-next from THIS worktree's
# install.sh into a temp consumer, then greps the SHIPPED eslint-rules-local copies.
