# cih-s2 F8 — the shipped AGENTS.md promises only scripts install actually delivers.
# Pre-S1, AGENTS.md listed `npm run test-storybook` + `npx playwright test` as if they were
# core, while install.sh shipped neither (no script key, no dep, no Storybook scaffold). This
# test asserts via the REAL install pipeline (mirror f11/f13) that:
#   (pos)  every `npm run X` in AGENTS.md OUTSIDE the UI-gated subsection is a real key in the
#          shipped package.json — so a doc promise can't outrun the install.
#   (gate) `test-storybook` + `playwright` live ONLY in the "### UI projects" subsection, not in
#          the unconditional core enumeration (an adjacent `# (UI projects)` comment is NOT enough).
#   (neg)  appending a fake `npm run __never__` to the shipped AGENTS.md makes the pos check FAIL —
#          proving the probe bites and is not vacuous.
