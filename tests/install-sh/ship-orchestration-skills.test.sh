# Ship the pipeline's orchestration companion skills to consumers.
# Pre-change, install.sh shipped only 3 skills (pipeline, tool-bootstrapping, rules-as-tests),
# leaving dispatcher (pipeline's execution companion: planning→execution via the aif-control
# loop), aif-doctor (runtime-bridge diagnosis), and template-audit (rendered-template audit)
# repo-internal — so a consumer's /pipeline run could plan but had no shipped dispatcher to
# execute, no aif-doctor to diagnose the runtime-bridge ./setup just installed, etc.
# This test asserts via the REAL install pipeline (mirror f8/f11/f13) that:
#   (pos)       the three orchestration companion skills land under .claude/skills/.
#   (transform) dispatcher's repo-internal markdown refs are rewritten to GitHub blob URLs
#               (the same transform pipeline gets) so a doc link can't point at a path absent
#               from the consumer tree.
#   (non-vac)   the SOURCE dispatcher actually carries such refs, so the transform check is
#               not vacuously passing on an empty set.
#   (neg)       a never-shipped skill name is genuinely absent — the existence check discriminates.
