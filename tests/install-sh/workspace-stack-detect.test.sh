# workspace-stack-detect.test.sh — per-workspace stack detection for multi-stack monorepos
# (§13.5, multi-stack-monorepo I-2 Layer 1 — DETECTION ONLY). The two new helpers live in
# setup.d/lib.sh (SSOT — layer-units.test.sh §4 guard forbids defining them in a numbered layer):
#
#   _workspace_pkg_dirs [root]        — enumerate workspace package dirs (those WITH a package.json)
#                                       under the 5-dir convention (apps packages services libs
#                                       modules — same set as setup.d/70-deps.sh:37), node-free, no
#                                       yq/pnpm/turbo dependency. Echoes one relative dir per line.
#   _detect_stacks_per_workspace [root] — walk each workspace dir × _detect_stack_from_pkg <dir> →
#                                       echo `dir<TAB>stack` per workspace (mirrors the 15-companions
#                                       DETECTED_STACK echo). A per-workspace `unknown` is a
#                                       re-checkable marker kept in the map, NOT dropped, NOT exit 1.
#
# T-MSM-A (kickoff §3): root-only detection silently drops the secondary stack (a pnpm monorepo's
# root package.json often has neither react-native nor next) — the #780 bug at the detection layer.
# Counter, proven below: detection walks PER-WORKSPACE; the paired-negative shows root-only detect
# drops apps/mobile's react-native that the per-workspace walk recovers.
#
# PAIRED-NEGATIVE (principle-02 non-vacuity, arch-target-monorepo.test.sh style): every property has
# an arm whose flip would fail — proving the assertions are load-bearing, not tautological.
#
# Layer-2 (on-disk marker / per-workspace `applies-to`/`files:` emission) is OUT OF SCOPE here.
