# the probe file that line hard-fails on a missing file. This test runs the REAL full pipeline

#   F6-pos: scripts/audit-r4.ts lands in the consumer.
#   F6-neg (load-bearing): the caller actually references scripts/audit-r4.ts — proves the file
#           is the thing the audit needs, so shipping it isn't vacuous.
