# react-spa-wiring.test.sh — install.sh must wire the react-spa preset the SAME way it wires
# react-next: `install.sh react-spa` is an accepted stack, the SPA eslint.config template lands as
# eslint.config.mjs, the preset's custom rule (require-error-boundary) lands in eslint-rules-local/,
# the generated barrel exports it, and EVERY `rules-as-tests/<id>` the shipped SPA eslint.config
# references resolves to a backing barrel export in the GENERATED consumer.
#
# The gap this closes (pre-existing, surfaced in the PR #708 cold-review): install.sh accepted only
# ts-server/react-next, so `install.sh react-spa` aborted with "Unknown stack" and NEVER copied
# packages/preset-react-spa/eslint-rules/require-error-boundary.ts or its eslint.config template —
# the SPA template's `rules-as-tests/require-error-boundary` ref would dangle at install time
# ("Definition for rule 'rules-as-tests/require-error-boundary' was not found"). Principle 25 guards
# ref-resolution STATICALLY in the source tree; this test proves the runtime COPY actually lands the
# backing rules in a generated consumer — the channel principle 25 cannot reach.
#
# Paired-negative (principle-02 non-vacuity): a fabricated `rules-as-tests/zzz-…` id run through the
# SAME resolver MUST be flagged unresolved — proving the resolution check is not vacuously green.
