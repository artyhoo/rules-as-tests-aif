# consumer-install-hardening S1 — F12: install.sh must ship workflow-integrity.yml so the R11
# "check" claim in the shipped .ai-factory/RULES.md matches reality. R11 names ci.yml's ci-success
# aggregate + workflow-integrity.yml (branch-protection-assertion); before this fix only ci.yml
# shipped, so the RULES.md claim referenced an artefact install never delivered. This test runs the
# REAL full pipeline (lib-only mode does not expose copy_safe — see install-sh harness note) and asserts:
#   F12-pos: .github/workflows/workflow-integrity.yml lands next to ci.yml (ts-server + react-next).
#   F12-neg (load-bearing): the shipped RULES.md R11 row references workflow-integrity.yml AND does
#           NOT claim actionlint/zizmor/audit-self.yml — proves the shipped workflow is the artefact
#           the rule names, and that no R11 claim points at an unshipped artefact.
