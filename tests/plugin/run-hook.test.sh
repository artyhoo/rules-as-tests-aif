# S1 acceptance — run-hook.cmd Unix path: dispatches a named sibling script; non-zero on missing arg.

#
# AUDIT FINDING (T13): superpowers' run-hook.cmd guards the missing-arg case only in its
# Windows batch block (`if "%~1"=="" ... exit /b 1`). On the Unix path there is no explicit
# guard — an empty name makes `exec bash "${SCRIPT_DIR}/"` fail with a NON-ZERO (not == 1)
# code. The contract we assert on Unix is therefore "non-zero", not "exactly 1".
