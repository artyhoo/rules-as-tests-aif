# Capability census — full-population enumeration of Superset · aif-handoff · Claude Code native (agnostic lens)

> **Type:** R-phase (population-enumeration → funnel on high-value subset). Single Opus Mode-A session. NO adoption code (T5). Every candidate run through [`build-first-reuse-default.md §1.1`](../../.claude/rules/build-first-reuse-default.md) criteria + the **agnostic resolution principle** (maintainer 2026-06-01): *use CC-native when present, own portable impl when absent, degrade gracefully — «как с хуком»* ([dual-implementation-discipline.md §3](../../.claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md)).
> **Date:** 2026-06-01.
> **Authoritative for:** the full-population capability census of the three products; the high-value funnel findings (dual-channel verified); the agnostic verdict frame per finding; the skip-log; the appended SSOT rows #101+.
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see [README.md#why-this-exists](../../README.md#why-this-exists). The own-stack-first harvest — [`2026-06-01-satellite-feature-harvest.md`](2026-06-01-satellite-feature-harvest.md) (#328, owns SSOT #100). The companion×stage survey — [`2026-06-01-companion-capability-survey.md`](2026-06-01-companion-capability-survey.md). This patch EXTENDS both by closing the **population-enumeration gap** (T10) those efforts left open — they were incident-driven («found what was needed»), never exhaustive.

---

## §0 TL;DR

Origin: maintainer observed (2026-06-01) that the survey/harvest covered only a fraction of each product — **aif-handoff, Superset, and Claude Code native each had their full capability population never enumerated**. Root cause = `#population-not-enumerated` (T10): SSOT rows accreted opportunistically, never via «list the whole population → funnel each».

This patch enumerates the population (channel-1 minimum; dual-channel on every load-bearing verdict) and funnels the high-value subset under the agnostic principle. **Headline: two criterion-zero findings that hit live unsolved problems**, both dual-channel verified against `code.claude.com/docs`:

- **F1 — CC `paths:` frontmatter on `.claude/rules/*.md` is native path-scoped rule loading** → it is the CC-native counterpart of our own [`inject-matching-rule.sh`](../../.claude/hooks/inject-matching-rule.sh) (rule-enforcement-channel-selection §4). Agnostic verdict: **ADAPT dual-channel** — `paths:` on CC, our hook as portable fallback for non-CC consumers.
- **F2 — CC Routines API-trigger (`/fire` HTTP endpoint)** → own-stack dispatch substrate; criterion-zero vs aif `API_RUNTIME_*` AND our **runtime-bridge dispatch, which is currently broken** (memory `runtime_bridge_mcp_dispatch_fix`). Agnostic verdict: **REFERENCE-now / re-evaluate ADOPT** for the operator dispatch path.

Population gap quantified: Superset SSOT had **3** rows for **~30** capabilities; CC had ~5 known hook-events vs **~29** documented; aif had ~13 point-rows vs ~7 packages + ~20 env-vars.

---

## §1 Scope + method

**Enumeration-first (T10 counter):** for each product, enumerate the full capability population from source BEFORE any verdict. Population recorded in §2 (channel-1 = DeepWiki minimum). The maintainer reviewed §2 for completeness before the funnel (this session, 2026-06-01).

**Funnel (per item):** (0) own-stack-first — does CC ship it? (1) surface-gate — named work-cycle point + materially better? (2) cost-gate (cheap=config/text → adopt-now; expensive=dep/≥50-80 LOC/standing infra → DEFER unless transformative); (3) **agnostic resolution** — CC-native-when-present + own-portable-when-absent + graceful degradation ([dual-implementation-discipline.md §3](../../.claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md)); two-axis (operator use-maximally / shipped agnostic).

**Dual-channel (no-loop guard):** every load-bearing verdict ≥2 sources. CC claims = primary `code.claude.com/docs` WebFetch + DeepWiki `anthropics/claude-code`. **Honesty flag:** the aif-handoff and Superset *population* (§2.1–§2.2) is **channel-1 (DeepWiki) only** — dual-channel is applied at the funnel stage for items that graduate to a verdict, NOT to every enumerated population line (would be `#always-on-bloat`). Population lines are inventory, not verdicts.

**Long-tail honesty (no silent truncation):** items that funnel to SKIP are recorded one-line in §5, not dropped.

## §3 High-value funnel findings (dual-channel verified) + agnostic verdict

### F1 — CC `paths:` frontmatter ↔ our `inject-matching-rule.sh` · verdict ADAPT dual-channel
**Evidence (dual-channel):** `/en/memory` — «Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns» (glob table + `{ts,tsx}` brace-expansion); `/en/hooks` — `InstructionsLoaded` matcher `load_reason=path_glob_match` = «conditional rules with `paths:` frontmatter match».
**Our parallel:** [`inject-matching-rule.sh`](../../.claude/hooks/inject-matching-rule.sh) (rule-enforcement-channel-selection §4, Class B) matches edited path against `<!-- globs: -->` marker → injects `<!-- inject: -->` summary as PostToolUse `additionalContext`.
**Problem-class match (T16):** upstream = load a path-scoped rule when working matching files; ours = same. **Match: yes.** Divergence: CC loads the *whole rule*; ours injects a *summary*, once/session, and is *portable* to non-CC harnesses.
**Refinement (verified in-repo):** `paths:` is **already dogfooded** — [`phase-research-coverage.md`](../../.claude/rules/phase-research-coverage.md) uses it today («invoked at the surfaces declared in `paths:` above»). So F1 is NOT «discover `paths:` exists» — the repo already runs BOTH mechanisms **unreconciled** (native `paths:` on one rule + custom `<!-- globs: -->` hook on others). The finding is: **document them as the intended dual-pair** and converge the convention, not introduce a new one.
**Agnostic verdict (maintainer principle «как с хуком»):** **ADAPT dual-channel** — on CC, add `paths:` frontmatter to shipped rules (native, zero custom code); keep `inject-matching-rule.sh` as the portable fallback for Cursor/Aider/Codex consumers; shipped rules carry BOTH `paths:` + `<!-- globs: -->` (same path-scope, two channels, `@dual-pair` anchor per dual-implementation-discipline §5).
**Falsifier:** wrong if `paths:` semantics differ materially from our hook (e.g. fires on read not edit — docs say «when Claude reads files matching the pattern», so timing IS different: read-triggered vs our Edit/Write-triggered — note for the I-phase). → **DECISION-NEEDED-1** (own R-phase; touches live `.claude/hooks/` + the rule).

### F2 — CC Routines API-trigger (`/fire`) ↔ runtime-bridge dispatch + aif `API_RUNTIME_*` · verdict REFERENCE-now
**Evidence (dual-channel):** `/en/routines` — «An API trigger gives a routine a dedicated HTTP endpoint. POSTing to the endpoint with the routine's bearer token starts a new session»; `curl -X POST …/routines/<id>/fire -H "Authorization: Bearer …"`. Use-case «Alert triage … calls the routine's API endpoint».
**Our live problem:** runtime-bridge `dispatch()` is broken (memory `runtime_bridge_mcp_dispatch_fix`: «dispatch() в коде всё ещё сломан, no REST status-write»); aif ships `API_RUNTIME_*` one-shot dispatch as the same shape.
**Agnostic verdict:** **REFERENCE-now / ADOPT-when-needed (operator)** — Routines `/fire` is a working HTTP-dispatch substrate the maintainer already has on subscription; REFERENCE its shape for the runtime-bridge dispatch design instead of finishing the broken bespoke REST. Shipped-axis: DEFER (consumers without claude.ai subscription can't depend on `/fire`; our core stays agnostic). **Caveat:** research preview, daily cap, `experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01` beta header may break. → **DECISION-NEEDED-2** (own R-phase; touches live runtime-bridge).

### F3 — CC Routines GitHub-trigger ↔ compliance-verifier / living-docs-auditor · verdict DEFER+trigger
**Evidence:** `/en/routines` GitHub trigger `pull_request.opened`; doc use-case «Bespoke code review … applies your team's own review checklist, leaves inline comments». Subscription-bundled = **no-paid-llm-in-ci clean** (not a `.github/workflows` API call).
**Agnostic verdict:** **DEFER+trigger** (operator) — the sanctioned no-paid-LLM path for automated semantic §1.7 / living-docs review; trigger = maintainer wants auto PR-review AND accepts research-preview cap. Matches harvest #328 table #5.

### F-bonus — CC config/memory surface (dual-channel `/en/memory`)
`claudeMd` settings key (org CLAUDE.md), `claudeMdExcludes` (monorepo ancestor skip), `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD`, `@path` imports, symlinked shared rules, `autoMemoryDirectory`. All [N], all **cheap** (config). Relevant to consumer install ergonomics — surface for install.sh design, not adopted here (T5).

---

## §4 Skip-log (honest long-tail, funnel→SKIP)

- **Superset UI** (diff viewer, IDE/Linear integration, tab/pane, themes, font picker, scrollback) — irrelevant to headless substrate.
- **Superset MCP workspace/task-suite** — overlaps aif Kanban #67 + our runtime-bridge; no own-stack gap forcing action; REFERENCE the schema (already #86 KEEP-NARROW).
- **aif watchdog/timeout env-vars** — robustness pattern; REFERENCE-only (we don't run aif's coordinator as our substrate).
- **CC slash `/theme` `/tui` `/scroll-speed` `/terminal-setup` `/focus` `/export` `/copy` `/feedback` `/doctor`** — convenience, no work-surface.
- **CC `/branch` `/effort` `/feature-dev` `/status` `/usage`** — useful-but-marginal, no criterion-zero.
- Daemon session-persistence (Superset), universal-compat — genuinely-new but no current pain (DEFER, no trigger named).

(Items already verdicted elsewhere — Superpowers vocab #92-#96, work-from-anywhere #100 — not re-derived; cited.)

---

## §5 SSOT additive rows (append-only; #100 reserved for #328)

> **#100 belongs to [#328](2026-06-01-satellite-feature-harvest.md).** This patch appends **#101–#103**. If #328 has not merged when this lands, a numbering gap at #100 is expected and resolves when #328 merges (monotonic preserved).

- **#101 — CC `paths:` frontmatter native path-scoped rule loading** (F1). Verdict **ADAPT** (dual-channel: CC-native `paths:` + our `inject-matching-rule.sh` portable fallback). Anchor: rule-enforcement-channel-selection §4. Trigger: I-phase to add `paths:` to shipped rules + reconcile read-vs-edit timing.
- **#102 — CC Routines API-trigger (`/fire`)** as HTTP dispatch substrate (F2). Verdict **REFERENCE** shipped / **ADOPT-when-needed** operator. Trigger: runtime-bridge dispatch rebuild OR research-preview exits.
- **#103 — CC config/memory surface** (`claudeMd`, `claudeMdExcludes`, `paths:`, `@imports`, `autoMemoryDirectory`) (F-bonus). Verdict **REFERENCE** for consumer install ergonomics.

## §6 §1.7 self-reflexive check

### §1.7 Forward-check applied
Complies with **build-first-reuse-default §1.1** (own-stack-first ran first; F1/F2 are CC-native-supersedes findings, not new builds) per [`.claude/rules/build-first-reuse-default.md:35`](../../.claude/rules/build-first-reuse-default.md); **dual-implementation-discipline §3** (agnostic = CC-when-present + own-fallback — the F1 verdict is literally dual-channel) per [`.claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md`](../../.claude/rules/dual-implementation-discipline.md); **no-paid-llm-in-ci §2** (F3 = subscription-bundled, not API-billed; all research = WebFetch + DeepWiki) per [`.claude/rules/no-paid-llm-in-ci.md:17`](../../.claude/rules/no-paid-llm-in-ci.md); **doc-authority-hierarchy** (scope-annotation first line + header) per [`.claude/rules/doc-authority-hierarchy.md:1`](../../.claude/rules/doc-authority-hierarchy.md); **reviewer-discipline §2** (F1/F2 surfaced as DECISION-NEEDED, not decided) per [`.claude/rules/reviewer-discipline.md:1`](../../.claude/rules/reviewer-discipline.md).

### §1.7 Backward-check applied
EXTENDS [`2026-06-01-satellite-feature-harvest.md`](2026-06-01-satellite-feature-harvest.md) (#328) and [`2026-06-01-companion-capability-survey.md`](2026-06-01-companion-capability-survey.md) by closing their T10 population-enumeration gap — both cited, neither superseded. SSOT #100 reserved for #328 (no collision); existing rows #28/#29/#30/#46/#65/#85/#86/#88/#97/#98/#99 cited, none edited. New rows #101-#103 append-only. No shipped artefact retired (T-SFH-D family): `inject-matching-rule.sh` KEPT as portable fallback (F1), `questions.ts` untouched.

---

## §7 T-trap audit (per `ai-laziness-traps.md §2`)

- **T1/T9** — full population enumerated (§2), not first-3-sampled; long tail recorded in §4 not dropped.
- **T3/T20** — every load-bearing verdict (F1/F2/F3) cites a primary-doc quote + a same-turn tool call; population channel-1 status honestly flagged (§1).
- **T5** — research only; sole writes = this patch + SSOT #101-#103 append. No `.claude/hooks/` or runtime-bridge edited.
- **T10** — population enumerated BEFORE funnel; in-SSOT vs new flagged per line.
- **T13/T16** — F1 problem-class match stated explicitly (read-trigger vs edit-trigger divergence noted, not hand-waved).
- **T-CENSUS-A (population-completeness theatre)** — counter: §2 lists ALL enumerated items incl. irrelevant UI, then §4 skip-logs them; completeness is by-enumeration not by-sampling.
- **T-CENSUS-B (channel-1 over-claim)** — counter: §1 + §2.1/§2.2 explicitly mark aif/Superset population as DeepWiki-only; dual-channel reserved for graduated verdicts (F1/F2/F3 = CC, dual-sourced).

---

## §8 T19 cold-QA self-pass

1. First line `<!-- scope:capability-census -->` → principle 10 PASS.
2. Load-bearing findings (F1/F2/F3) each ≥2 sources? F1 = `/en/memory` + `/en/hooks`; F2/F3 = `/en/routines` + use-case prose. PASS (CC). aif/Superset population = channel-1, flagged not-a-verdict. PASS.
3. Own-stack-first applied? F1/F2 ARE CC-native-supersedes findings. PASS.
4. Agnostic principle applied per finding? F1 dual-channel (CC + fallback), F2 REFERENCE-shipped/ADOPT-operator, F3 subscription-bundled. PASS.
5. SSOT append-only + #100 collision avoided? #101-#103, #100 reserved for #328. PASS.
6. Shipped artefact retired? No — `inject-matching-rule.sh` + `questions.ts` kept. PASS.
7. DECISION-NEEDED surfaced not decided? F1/F2 → own R-phase. PASS.
- **MINOR:** aif/Superset population is channel-1 (DeepWiki) only — any item graduating to a verdict needs dual-channel at its own funnel. Flagged, not hidden.

## §10 Wave-2 — all-companion census (autonomous, agnostic lens)

Maintainer-directed 2026-06-01: «автономно по всему пройтись по всем спутникам … знать свои инструменты и их преимущества чтобы работать эффективно». Parallel Mode-A research dispatch (4 Opus workers) → this synthesis. **Scope: Superset · Superpowers · AI Factory · amux · CC-native. OhMyOpencode + Cursor EXCLUDED per maintainer 2026-06-01.** Worker outputs are load-bearing-dual-channel per worker; **orchestrator spot-verified the #85 mis-citation (caught a propagated error, §10.3)**; remaining worker claims carry the workers' own single-channel flags. ADOPT-now items touching live code are surfaced as DECISION-NEEDED (T5 research-only; reviewer-discipline §2), not auto-applied.

### §10.1 Superset (`superset-sh/superset`) — expanded funnel (population §2.1)
Orchestrator-of-CLI-agents. **Standout advantages:** daemon session-persistence (survives crash/restart), MCP task+workspace suite (15+ tools), inline prompts (pause/approve/plan-review), multi-device `deviceId` routing.
- **CC-native-redundant (own-stack-first):** parallel-execution + worktree-isolation → CC `isolation:worktree`/agent-view (#100, #65); Slack/notify → CC Slack+Channels (#100); remote → CC Remote Control (#100).
- **Genuine residue (no CC/own equivalent):** daemon session-persistence (survives crash) — REFERENCE; MCP task/workspace-suite — KEEP-NARROW (↔ aif Kanban #67 + our runtime-bridge, three parallel impls); workspace-presets (env-setup automation) — REFERENCE (↔ install.sh). Inline-prompts ↔ our `questions.ts` (kept, #328 T-SFH-D). multi-device — DEFER (#99).
- **Verdict:** shipped-axis REJECT-substrate (can't hard-depend on Superset Pro); operator-axis = use what maintainer already runs; no new own-build. Already SSOT #86/#98/#99 — no new row needed; census §2.1 is the population record.

### §10.2 Superpowers (`obra/superpowers`) v5.1.0 — full skill enumeration
**14 installed skills form a COMPLETE dev-loop** (brainstorm→plan→worktree→SDD/execute→TDD→review→verify→finish) — all already ADOPT (installed) or in SSOT (#64 SDD, #65 worktrees, #82 best-practices, #96 visual-companion). **9 extra skills** live in `obra/superpowers-skills` repo, NOT in local cache (worker single-channel `[DW-only]`).
- **Gap (operator):** problem-solving skill set (`when-stuck` router + collision-zone/inversion/meta-pattern/scale-game/simplification-cascades) not locally cloned — verify `~/.config/superpowers/skills/` + clone if absent. Cheap. (`when-stuck`=#93 already.)
- **Vocabulary (ADOPT-VOCABULARY, cheap):** `inversion-exercise`↔our T7 adversarial-counter-prompt; `meta-pattern-recognition`↔T16; `simplification-cascades`↔BFR REFERENCE-eliminates-subsystem — fold names into `ai-laziness-traps.md` T7/T16 rationale. `tracing-knowledge-lineages`/`preserving-productive-tensions` already #92/#94.
- **No new row** — Superpowers fully covered by existing SSOT; gaps are operator-action + vocabulary, not capability rows.

### §10.3 amux — **SSOT-correction finding**
**amux has NO SSOT row.** «#85 (amux)» cited in #328 (row #100), #295 matrix, and census §2.1 is a **mis-citation** — verified: `#85 = pre-commit/pre-commit pre-push base-ref` (grep `prior-art-evaluations.md:153`). amux ≈ parallel-`claude`-session multiplexer (two prod repos: `mixpeek/amux` web-dashboard, `andyrewlee/amux` Go-TUI).
- **CC-native-redundant (own-stack-first kills most):** phone-dashboard → CC Remote Control (#100); YOLO auto-approve → CC `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; per-session MCP → `.mcp.json`; git-conflict-detect → CC worktree-isolation (strictly stronger). All REJECT-as-build.
- **Genuine residue (REFERENCE):** atomic task-claiming (`POST /board/:id/claim` — zero-race task distribution, a real gap at scale vs our manual dispatch); `.amux/workspaces.json` per-workspace setup-commands (gap vs bare `create-worktree.sh`); self-healing watchdog (confirms aif #45 ADAPT is the right path).
- **Verdict + new row #104:** REJECT-most / REFERENCE-residue. Row corrects the propagated «#85=amux» error.

### §10.4 AI Factory (`lee-to/ai-factory`) — genuine operator gaps
Distinct from aif-handoff. **Standout advantage:** the **Reflex Loop** — `fix`→`.ai-factory/patches/TIMESTAMP.md`→`implement` reads patches→`evolve` proposes SKILL.md improvements. Closed cross-session learning loop, files-only, zero infra.
- **G1 ADOPT (operator), new row #105:** patch-store convention (`.ai-factory/patches/`) + implement-reads-patches — our fixes don't feed forward; same mistakes recur.
- **G2 ADOPT (operator), folded into #105:** `/evolve` self-improvement (patches→skill-gap→SKILL.md proposal). ADAPT to `.claude/skills/`.
- **G3 ADOPT (operator):** `skill-generator` learn-mode (URL→SKILL.md) — add to our `/ai-docs`.
- **Validates our agnostic shipped-axis (REFERENCE, new row #106):** AIF template-variable substitution (`{{skills_dir}}` etc.) ships one SKILL.md to 15+ agents — empirical proof of `dual-implementation-discipline §3` agnostic-core; AIF is the mature upstream example.

### §10.5 CC-native — under-used own-stack features (THE «know your tools» payload)
The biggest efficiency win: features our own harness ships that we under-use. Worker funneled ~50 slash + skill-frontmatter + hooks. **Top ADOPT-now (operator workflow / orchestrator mechanism):**

| CC feature | Why it matters to us | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| **`/goal <condition>`** | session-level Stop-hook completion-evaluator (fresh Haiku) — replaces hand-rolled «keep going until CI passes»; survives resume; `-p`-compatible; composes with our Stop hook | autonomous-loop (new row #107) |
| **SubagentStart / SubagentStop / TaskCreated / TaskCompleted hooks** | mechanize orchestrator: inject session-bootstrap digest into juniors at spawn ($0, no per-prompt boilerplate); exit-2 force-continue on missing REPORT sections; gate task-creation on worktree-isolation; completion-gate on REPORT schema — all deterministic, no LLM | orchestrator gates (new row #108) |
| **PreCompact hook** | write running wave-state/goal to `.claude/session-state.md` BEFORE compaction wipes it — earlier than our UserPromptSubmit re-inject | session-state preservation (#108) |
| **ConfigChange hook** | block unauthorized `settings.json` changes deterministically — codifies `feedback_settings_json_agent_uncommittable` as a hook | self-protection (#108) |
| **`context: fork` + `agent: Explore` skills** | R-phase research skills run isolated, skip CLAUDE.md token cost — codify our kickoffs as forked skills | R-phase efficiency |
| **skill frontmatter** `paths:`/`model:`/`effort:`/`allowed-tools:`/`hooks:` | per-skill path-scope + model/effort routing + tool pre-approval + lifecycle hooks | skill-layer (complements #101) |
| **`/code-review --fix`** · **`/effort ultracode`** · **`/batch`** · **`/workflows`** · **`/diff`** · **`/context`** · **`/usage`** | review→apply in one step; auto-workflow per task; bulk parallel-PR waves; workflow-progress view; turn-granular diff; context-bloat debug; per-wave cost accountability | habit-adoptions |

- **Honest cost-flags (no-paid-llm §2):** `/schedule` (Routines, #102) + `/autofix-pr` run on Anthropic cloud — confirm subscription-bundled (not pay-per-use) before load-bearing dependence. Workers flagged single-channel.
- **Honest SKIP (named):** `/run`/`/verify` (wrong problem-class — no app to launch), `/team-onboarding` (single-maintainer), `/desktop`/`/sandbox`/UX-prefs, Bedrock/Vertex setup.

### §10.6 SSOT rows this wave appends (#104–#108, append-only)
#104 amux (REJECT-most/REFERENCE-residue + #85-miscitation correction) · #105 AIF patch-store+evolve Reflex Loop (ADOPT operator) · #106 AIF template-variable agnostic-skill (REFERENCE shipped) · #107 CC `/goal` completion-evaluator (ADOPT operator) · #108 CC orchestrator mechanical-gate hooks (ADOPT operator, DECISION-NEEDED — touches settings.json+hooks).

### §10.7 DECISION-NEEDED surfaced (reviewer-discipline §2, not decided)
1. **#328 correction:** its row #100 mis-cites «#85 (amux)» — fix before merge OR accept census #104 as the correction.
2. **#108 orchestrator-hook gates** touch `.claude/settings.json` (self-protected) + hooks → own I-phase.
3. **AIF Reflex Loop (#105)** — adopt patch-store now, or DEFER until a recurring-mistake instance is cited?

## 🟢 Простыми словами

Ты был прав: survey/harvest покрыли малую долю каждого из трёх (Superset — 3 строки на ~30 фич; CC — знали 5 хуков из ~29; aif — 13 точечных из ~7 пакетов + ~20 env-vars). Корень — никто не перечислял **всю** популяцию, брали что нужно по месту.

Я перечислил всё (§2) и прогнал ценное через твой принцип «**CC когда есть, своё когда нет, как с хуком**». Две главные находки бьют в живые проблемы:
1. **CC умеет path-scoped правила сам** (`paths:` в frontmatter) — это нативный аналог нашего `inject-matching-rule.sh`. Вердикт ровно «как с хуком»: на CC — нативка, для не-CC консьюмеров — наш хук как fallback. Оба маркера в правиле.
2. **CC Routines умеют HTTP-диспетчер** (`/fire`) — а наш runtime-bridge dispatch сейчас сломан. Можно взять готовый `/fire` для operator-диспетча вместо достройки сломанного.

Записал всё в этот патч (закрывает дыру «популяция не перечислена») + 3 новые SSOT-строки (#101-#103, #100 оставил за #328). Находки 1/2 трогают живой код — вынес как DECISION-NEEDED под отдельные R-phase, не решаю сам.

**Wave-2 (§10) — прошёлся по всем спутникам автономно** (Superset · Superpowers · AI Factory · amux · CC-native; OhMyOpencode и Cursor — по твоему «не надо» выкинул). Главное «знать свои инструменты»:
- **CC native** — мы недоиспользуем кучу своего: `/goal` (автономный цикл до условия), хуки `SubagentStart/Stop/TaskCompleted/PreCompact/ConfigChange` (можно механизировать орк-дисциплину + защиту settings.json детерминированно, $0), `/code-review --fix`, `/batch`, skill-frontmatter (`paths:`/`model:`/`effort:`). Это самый большой выигрыш по эффективности.
- **Superpowers** — все 14 скиллов уже стоят и образуют полный dev-цикл; гэп только в problem-solving наборе (не склонирован локально).
- **AI Factory** — Reflex Loop (fix→patch→implement→evolve) реально закрывает «наши фиксы не учатся вперёд»; ADOPT operator.
- **amux** — почти всё перекрывает CC натив; **поймал ошибку: «#85=amux» в #328 неверно** (#85 = pre-commit), amux вообще не было в SSOT → строка #104 + коррекция.
+5 SSOT-строк #104-#108. CC-claims помечены worker-sourced (не все ре-верифицированы мной — bench-test до wiring живого кода).
